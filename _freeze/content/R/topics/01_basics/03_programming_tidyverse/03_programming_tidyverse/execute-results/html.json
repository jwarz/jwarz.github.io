Discover the fundamentals of the Tidyverse, and learn all about renaming and reordering variables, while becoming familiar with binomial distribution.\n\n**Long Description**\n\nThis is an introduction to the programming language R, focused on a powerful set of tools known as the Tidyverse. You'll learn the intertwined processes of data manipulation and visualization using the tools dplyr and ggplot2. You'll learn to manipulate data by filtering, sorting, and summarizing a real dataset of historical country data in order to answer exploratory questions. You'll then learn to turn this processed data into informative line plots, bar plots, histograms, and more with the ggplot2 package. You’ll get a taste of the value of exploratory data analysis and the power of Tidyverse tools. This is a suitable introduction for those who have no previous experience in R and are interested in performing data analysis.\n\n# 1. Data Wrangling\n\nIn this chapter, you'll learn to do three things with a table: filter for particular observations, arrange the observations in a desired order, and mutate to add or change a column. You'll see how each of these steps allows you to answer questions about your data.\n\n## The gapminder dataset\n\nTheory. Coming soon ...\n\n**1. The gapminder dataset**\n\nHi, I'm Dave Robinson and I'll be your instructor. I'm a data scientist and I love using R to dive into a dataset and discover interesting things. This course will get you started on the path to exploring and visualizing your own data with the R programming language. This course introduces you to gapminder.\n\n**2. Tidyverse**\n\nto the tidyverse, a collection of data science tools within R for transforming and visualizing data. This is not the only set of tools in R, but it's a powerful and popular approach for exploring data. At every step, you'll be analyzing a real dataset called\n\n**3. Gapminder**\n\nGapminder. Gapminder tracks economic and social indicators like life expectancy and the GDP per capita of countries over time. The experience you gain on this example will help you in analyzing your own data. You'll learn to draw specific insights and\n\n**4. 4 Plots**\n\ncommunicate them through informative visualizations with the ggplot2 package. This course is interactive: between the short videos you'll complete exercises by typing in code, with help from us along the way. The\n\n**5. Loading packages**\n\nfirst code you'll write is to load two R packages, which is done by writing \"library parenthesis, the name of the package, then end parenthesis\". R packages are tools that aren't built into the language, but were created later by other programmers. Each of them provides tools that you don't have to write yourself.The first package is gapminder, created by Jenny Bryan, which contains the dataset that you'll be analyzing. The second package is dplyr, created by Hadley Wickham, which provides step-by-step tools for transforming this data, such as filtering, sorting, and summarizing it. You type\n\n**6. The gapminder dataset**\n\ngapminder to display the contents of the gapminder object, which is structured as a data frame. A data frame keeps rectangular data in rows and columns, similar to a spreadsheet, or a table in a SQL database. Most data analyses in R, and everything you'll do in this course, are centered around data frames. As described in the first line of the output, this is a special type of data frame called a tibble, though for now you don't have to worry about the difference.R displays the first ten rows so that you can get a glimpse of it, and you can see a short description in the first line. This tells you the tibble has one thousand seven hundred and four rows, each of which we call an observation. It has six columns, each of which we call a variable.It's important in an analysis to understand what each observation, or row, represents. Here, each represents a unique pair of a country and a year. For example, the first observation represents country statistics for Afghanistan in 1952, the second for Afghanistan in 1957, and so on.For each combination of a country and year, the dataset contains several variables, or columns, describing the country's demographics. We see the continent - in this case, Asia - the life expectancy in years, the population, and the GDP per capita. The GDP per capita is the country's total economic output (Gross Domestic Product) divided by its population, and it's a common measure of how wealthy a country is. Each variable is of one consistent data type: some are numbers, like life expectancy and population, and some are categorical, like country and continent.Even with this small glimpse of the data, you can extract a few insights. For example, you can see that Afghanistan's life expectancy and population have both gone up from 1952 to 1997, but that its GDP per capita has wavered. In the rest of this course, you'll learn to use R to draw many conclusions about the social and economic history of countries around the world.\n\n## Loading the gapminder and dplyr packages\n\nBefore you can work with the `gapminder` dataset, you'll need to load two R packages that contain the tools for working with it, then display the `gapminder` dataset so that you can see what it contains.\n\nTo your right, you'll see two windows inside which you can enter code: The `script.R` window, and the R Console. All of your code to solve each exercise must go inside `script.R`. \n\nIf you hit *Submit Answer*, your R script is executed and the output is shown in the R Console. DataCamp checks whether your submission is correct and gives you feedback. You can hit *Submit Answer* as often as you want. If you're stuck, you can ask for a hint or a solution.\n\nYou can use the R Console interactively by simply typing R code and hitting Enter. When you work in the console directly, your code will not be checked for correctness so it is a great way to experiment and explore.\n\n*This course introduces a lot of new concepts, so if you ever need a quick refresher, download the <a href=\"https://datacamp-community-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/e63a8f6b-2aa3-4006-89e0-badc294b179c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">tidyverse for beginners Cheat Sheet</a> and keep it handy!*\n\n**Steps**\n\n1. Use the `library()` function to load the `dplyr` package, just like we've loaded the `gapminder` package for you.\n2. Type `gapminder`, on its own line, to look at the gapminder dataset.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Load the gapminder package\nlibrary(gapminder)\n\n# Load the dplyr package\nlibrary(dplyr)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Look at the gapminder dataset\ngapminder\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<div data-pagedtable=\"false\">\n  <script data-pagedtable-source type=\"application/json\">\n{\"columns\":[{\"label\":[\"country\"],\"name\":[1],\"type\":[\"fct\"],\"align\":[\"left\"]},{\"label\":[\"continent\"],\"name\":[2],\"type\":[\"fct\"],\"align\":[\"left\"]},{\"label\":[\"year\"],\"name\":[3],\"type\":[\"int\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]},{\"label\":[\"lifeExp\"],\"name\":[4],\"type\":[\"dbl\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]},{\"label\":[\"pop\"],\"name\":[5],\"type\":[\"int\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]},{\"label\":[\"gdpPercap\"],\"name\":[6],\"type\":[\"dbl\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]}],\"data\":[{\"1\":\"Afghanistan\",\"2\":\"Asia\",\"3\":\"1952\",\"4\":\"28.801\",\"5\":\"8425333\",\"6\":\"779.4453\"},{\"1\":\"Afghanistan\",\"2\":\"Asia\",\"3\":\"1957\",\"4\":\"30.332\",\"5\":\"9240934\",\"6\":\"820.8530\"},{\"1\":\"Afghanistan\",\"2\":\"Asia\",\"3\":\"1962\",\"4\":\"31.997\",\"5\":\"10267083\",\"6\":\"853.1007\"},{\"1\":\"Afghanistan\",\"2\":\"Asia\",\"3\":\"1967\",\"4\":\"34.020\",\"5\":\"11537966\",\"6\":\"836.1971\"},{\"1\":\"Afghanistan\",\"2\":\"Asia\",\"3\":\"1972\",\"4\":\"36.088\",\"5\":\"13079460\",\"6\":\"739.9811\"},{\"1\":\"Afghanistan\",\"2\":\"Asia\",\"3\":\"1977\",\"4\":\"38.438\",\"5\":\"14880372\",\"6\":\"786.1134\"},{\"1\":\"Afghanistan\",\"2\":\"Asia\",\"3\":\"1982\",\"4\":\"39.854\",\"5\":\"12881816\",\"6\":\"978.0114\"},{\"1\":\"Afghanistan\",\"2\":\"Asia\",\"3\":\"1987\",\"4\":\"40.822\",\"5\":\"13867957\",\"6\":\"852.3959\"},{\"1\":\"Afghanistan\",\"2\":\"Asia\",\"3\":\"1992\",\"4\":\"41.674\",\"5\":\"16317921\",\"6\":\"649.3414\"},{\"1\":\"Afghanistan\",\"2\":\"Asia\",\"3\":\"1997\",\"4\":\"41.763\",\"5\":\"22227415\",\"6\":\"635.3414\"}],\"options\":{\"columns\":{\"min\":{},\"max\":[10]},\"rows\":{\"min\":[10],\"max\":[10]},\"pages\":{}}}\n  </script>\n</div>\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\nGreat job! Notice that you can see the gapminder dataset in the output. This is called 'printing' a dataset.\n\n## Understanding a data frame\n\nNow that you've loaded the `gapminder` dataset, you can start examining and understanding it.\n\nWe've already loaded the `gapminder` and `dplyr` packages. Type `gapminder` in the console, to display the object.\n\n> *Question*\n> ---\n> How many observations (rows) are in the dataset?<br>\n> <br>\n> ✅ 1704<br>\n> ⬜ 6<br>\n> ⬜ 1694<br>\n> ⬜ 1952<br>\n\n## The filter verb\n\nTheory. Coming soon ...\n\n**1. The filter verb**\n\nNow that you've been introduced to the gapminder data, you'll learn the tools to work with it. In the rest of this chapter you'll learn about the \"verbs\" in the dplyr package - these are the atomic steps you use to transform data. The first verb you'll use is filter.\n\n**2. The filter verb**\n\nYou use filter when you want to look only at a subset of your observations, based on a particular condition. Filtering data is a common first step in an analysis. Every time you apply a verb, you'll use a pipe.\n\n**3. Filtering for one year**\n\nA pipe is a percent, greater than, percent. It says \"take whatever is before it, and feed it into the next step.\"After the pipe, we can perform our first verb. We have data on many years, but we'd like to filter for just one. Let's say we filter for 2007, the most recent data in the dataset.The \"year equals equals 2007\" is the condition we are using to filter observations. The \"equals equals\" may be surprising: it's what we call a \"logical equals\"- an operation to compare two values: each year, and the number 2007. A single equals here would mean something different in R, which you'll see later.Here, we're saying we want to filter for only the observations from 2007. Let's see what this code outputs. Notice that now, we have only 142 rows: that's how many countries are in the dataset.It's important to note that you're not removing any rows from the original gapminder data. You can still use the gapminder object for other analyses, and it won't be any different than it was before. Instead, filter is returning a new dataset, one with fewer rows, that then gets printed to the screen. You could choose another condition to filter on,\n\n**4. Filtering for one country**\n\nbesides the year. For example, suppose we wanted to get only the observations from the United States.We would write this as \"filter country equals equals quote United States endquote\", resulting in only the 12 observations from that country.The quotes around United States are important: otherwise R won't understand that the words \"United\" and \"States\" are the content of a text variable, as opposed to variable names. You didn't need quotes around a number like 2007, but you do around text. Finally,\n\n**5. Filtering for two variables**\n\nwe can specify multiple conditions in the filter.Each of the conditions is separated by a comma: here we are saying we want only the one observation for the year 2007, comma, where the country is the United States. Each of these equals equals expressions is called an argument.This kind of double filter is useful for extracting a single observation you're interested in. You'll be able to practice this in the exercises.\n\n\n## Filtering for one year\n\nThe `filter()` verb extracts particular observations based on a condition. In this exercise you'll filter for observations from a particular year.\n\n**Steps**\n\n1. Add a `filter()` line after the pipe (`%>%`) to extract only the observations from the year 1957. Remember that you use `==` to compare two values.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Filter the gapminder dataset for the year 1957\ngapminder %>% filter(year == 1957)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<div data-pagedtable=\"false\">\n  <script data-pagedtable-source type=\"application/json\">\n{\"columns\":[{\"label\":[\"country\"],\"name\":[1],\"type\":[\"fct\"],\"align\":[\"left\"]},{\"label\":[\"continent\"],\"name\":[2],\"type\":[\"fct\"],\"align\":[\"left\"]},{\"label\":[\"year\"],\"name\":[3],\"type\":[\"int\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]},{\"label\":[\"lifeExp\"],\"name\":[4],\"type\":[\"dbl\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]},{\"label\":[\"pop\"],\"name\":[5],\"type\":[\"int\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]},{\"label\":[\"gdpPercap\"],\"name\":[6],\"type\":[\"dbl\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]}],\"data\":[{\"1\":\"Afghanistan\",\"2\":\"Asia\",\"3\":\"1957\",\"4\":\"30.332\",\"5\":\"9240934\",\"6\":\"820.8530\"},{\"1\":\"Albania\",\"2\":\"Europe\",\"3\":\"1957\",\"4\":\"59.280\",\"5\":\"1476505\",\"6\":\"1942.2842\"},{\"1\":\"Algeria\",\"2\":\"Africa\",\"3\":\"1957\",\"4\":\"45.685\",\"5\":\"10270856\",\"6\":\"3013.9760\"},{\"1\":\"Angola\",\"2\":\"Africa\",\"3\":\"1957\",\"4\":\"31.999\",\"5\":\"4561361\",\"6\":\"3827.9405\"},{\"1\":\"Argentina\",\"2\":\"Americas\",\"3\":\"1957\",\"4\":\"64.399\",\"5\":\"19610538\",\"6\":\"6856.8562\"},{\"1\":\"Australia\",\"2\":\"Oceania\",\"3\":\"1957\",\"4\":\"70.330\",\"5\":\"9712569\",\"6\":\"10949.6496\"},{\"1\":\"Austria\",\"2\":\"Europe\",\"3\":\"1957\",\"4\":\"67.480\",\"5\":\"6965860\",\"6\":\"8842.5980\"},{\"1\":\"Bahrain\",\"2\":\"Asia\",\"3\":\"1957\",\"4\":\"53.832\",\"5\":\"138655\",\"6\":\"11635.7995\"},{\"1\":\"Bangladesh\",\"2\":\"Asia\",\"3\":\"1957\",\"4\":\"39.348\",\"5\":\"51365468\",\"6\":\"661.6375\"},{\"1\":\"Belgium\",\"2\":\"Europe\",\"3\":\"1957\",\"4\":\"69.240\",\"5\":\"8989111\",\"6\":\"9714.9606\"}],\"options\":{\"columns\":{\"min\":{},\"max\":[10]},\"rows\":{\"min\":[10],\"max\":[10]},\"pages\":{}}}\n  </script>\n</div>\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThat's right! Notice that all the observations in the output have the year 1957.\n\n## Filtering for one country and one year\n\nYou can also use the `filter()` verb to set two conditions, which could retrieve a single observation. \n\nJust like in the last exercise, you can do this in two lines of code, starting with `gapminder %>%` and having the `filter()` on the second line. Keeping one verb on each line helps keep the code readable. Note that each time, you'll put the pipe `%>%` at the end of the first line (like `gapminder %>%`); putting the pipe at the beginning of the second line will throw an error.\n\n**Steps**\n\n1. Filter the `gapminder` data to retrieve only the observation from China in the year 2002.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Filter for China in 2002\ngapminder %>% \n  filter(country == \"China\") %>%\n  filter(year == 2002)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<div data-pagedtable=\"false\">\n  <script data-pagedtable-source type=\"application/json\">\n{\"columns\":[{\"label\":[\"country\"],\"name\":[1],\"type\":[\"fct\"],\"align\":[\"left\"]},{\"label\":[\"continent\"],\"name\":[2],\"type\":[\"fct\"],\"align\":[\"left\"]},{\"label\":[\"year\"],\"name\":[3],\"type\":[\"int\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]},{\"label\":[\"lifeExp\"],\"name\":[4],\"type\":[\"dbl\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]},{\"label\":[\"pop\"],\"name\":[5],\"type\":[\"int\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]},{\"label\":[\"gdpPercap\"],\"name\":[6],\"type\":[\"dbl\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]}],\"data\":[{\"1\":\"China\",\"2\":\"Asia\",\"3\":\"2002\",\"4\":\"72.028\",\"5\":\"1280400000\",\"6\":\"3119.281\"}],\"options\":{\"columns\":{\"min\":{},\"max\":[10]},\"rows\":{\"min\":[10],\"max\":[10]},\"pages\":{}}}\n  </script>\n</div>\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\nGood work! This is a useful way to grab a single observation you're interested in.\n\n## The arrange verb\n\nTheory. Coming soon ...\n\n**1. The arrange verb**\n\nIn the last video you learned the filter verb, for extracting a subset of your observations based on a condition. Now you'll learn the arrange verb.\n\n**2. The arrange verb**\n\narrange sorts the observations in a dataset, in ascending or descending order based on one of its variables. This is useful, for example, when you want to know the most extreme values in a dataset.\n\n**3. Sorting with arrange**\n\nJust like filter, you use the arrange verb after the pipe operator. You would type gapminder, then the pipe operator- percent, greater than, percent- and then arrange. Within those parentheses, you tell it what column you want to arrange by.The observations are now sorted in ascending order, with the lowest GDP per capita appearing first. Look at the rightmost column: notice that it starts with 241, the smallest value in the dataset, then keeps increasing. You can see that the country-year pair with the lowest GDP per capita was the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 2002.Just like with filter, the gapminder object itself is unchanged: arrange is just giving you a new, sorted dataset. Arrange also lets you sort in descending order.\n\n**4. Sorting in descending order**\n\nTo do that, you'd put the D-E-S-C- for descending- around the variable you're sorting by.This lets us see that the country-year pair with the highest GDP per capita was Kuwait in the year 1957. Looking across all countries and all years might not be that useful. Suppose you wanted to find the highest GDP-per-capita countries in just one year.\n\n**5. Filtering then arranging**\n\nTo do that, you can combine the two verbs you've already learned: filter, and arrange.You start with the gapminder dataset, then a pipe to give the dataset to filter. Then you specify that you want to filter for year equals equals 2007. Then you use another pipe. This takes the result of the filter, and gives it to arrange. You specify that you want to sort in descending order of GDP per capita.This shows you that the countries with the highest GDP per capita in 2007 were Norway, Kuwait, Singapore, and the United States.We can explore many such questions with various combinations of dplyr verbs. Over the course of these lessons, you'll learn to pipe together multiple simple operations to create a rich and informative data analysis.\n\n## Arranging observations by life expectancy\n\nYou use `arrange()` to sort observations in ascending or descending order of a particular variable. In this case, you'll sort the dataset based on the `lifeExp` variable.\n\n**Steps**\n\n1. Sort the `gapminder` dataset in ascending order of life expectancy (`lifeExp`).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Sort in ascending order of lifeExp\ngapminder %>% arrange(lifeExp)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<div data-pagedtable=\"false\">\n  <script data-pagedtable-source type=\"application/json\">\n{\"columns\":[{\"label\":[\"country\"],\"name\":[1],\"type\":[\"fct\"],\"align\":[\"left\"]},{\"label\":[\"continent\"],\"name\":[2],\"type\":[\"fct\"],\"align\":[\"left\"]},{\"label\":[\"year\"],\"name\":[3],\"type\":[\"int\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]},{\"label\":[\"lifeExp\"],\"name\":[4],\"type\":[\"dbl\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]},{\"label\":[\"pop\"],\"name\":[5],\"type\":[\"int\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]},{\"label\":[\"gdpPercap\"],\"name\":[6],\"type\":[\"dbl\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]}],\"data\":[{\"1\":\"Rwanda\",\"2\":\"Africa\",\"3\":\"1992\",\"4\":\"23.599\",\"5\":\"7290203\",\"6\":\"737.0686\"},{\"1\":\"Afghanistan\",\"2\":\"Asia\",\"3\":\"1952\",\"4\":\"28.801\",\"5\":\"8425333\",\"6\":\"779.4453\"},{\"1\":\"Gambia\",\"2\":\"Africa\",\"3\":\"1952\",\"4\":\"30.000\",\"5\":\"284320\",\"6\":\"485.2307\"},{\"1\":\"Angola\",\"2\":\"Africa\",\"3\":\"1952\",\"4\":\"30.015\",\"5\":\"4232095\",\"6\":\"3520.6103\"},{\"1\":\"Sierra Leone\",\"2\":\"Africa\",\"3\":\"1952\",\"4\":\"30.331\",\"5\":\"2143249\",\"6\":\"879.7877\"},{\"1\":\"Afghanistan\",\"2\":\"Asia\",\"3\":\"1957\",\"4\":\"30.332\",\"5\":\"9240934\",\"6\":\"820.8530\"},{\"1\":\"Cambodia\",\"2\":\"Asia\",\"3\":\"1977\",\"4\":\"31.220\",\"5\":\"6978607\",\"6\":\"524.9722\"},{\"1\":\"Mozambique\",\"2\":\"Africa\",\"3\":\"1952\",\"4\":\"31.286\",\"5\":\"6446316\",\"6\":\"468.5260\"},{\"1\":\"Sierra Leone\",\"2\":\"Africa\",\"3\":\"1957\",\"4\":\"31.570\",\"5\":\"2295678\",\"6\":\"1004.4844\"},{\"1\":\"Burkina Faso\",\"2\":\"Africa\",\"3\":\"1952\",\"4\":\"31.975\",\"5\":\"4469979\",\"6\":\"543.2552\"}],\"options\":{\"columns\":{\"min\":{},\"max\":[10]},\"rows\":{\"min\":[10],\"max\":[10]},\"pages\":{}}}\n  </script>\n</div>\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\n2.

Take a look at the countries with the highest and lowest life expectancy- is it similar to what you expected?\n\n## Filtering and arranging\n\nYou'll often need to use the pipe operator (`%>%`) to combine multiple dplyr verbs in a row. In this case, you'll combine a `filter()` with an `arrange()` to find the highest population countries in a particular year.\n\n\n**Steps**\n\n1. Use `filter()` to extract observations from just the year 1957, then use `arrange()` to sort in descending order of population (`pop`).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Filter for the year 1957, then arrange in descending order of population\ngapminder %>% \n  filter(year == 1957) %>%\n  arrange(desc(pop))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<div data-pagedtable=\"false\">\n  <script data-pagedtable-source type=\"application/json\">\n{\"columns\":[{\"label\":[\"country\"],\"name\":[1],\"type\":[\"fct\"],\"align\":[\"left\"]},{\"label\":[\"continent\"],\"name\":[2],\"type\":[\"fct\"],\"align\":[\"left\"]},{\"label\":[\"year\"],\"name\":[3],\"type\":[\"int\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]},{\"label\":[\"lifeExp\"],\"name\":[4],\"type\":[\"dbl\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]},{\"label\":[\"pop\"],\"name\":[5],\"type\":[\"int\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]},{\"label\":[\"gdpPercap\"],\"name\":[6],\"type\":[\"dbl\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]}],\"data\":[{\"1\":\"China\",\"2\":\"Asia\",\"3\":\"1957\",\"4\":\"50.54896\",\"5\":\"637408000\",\"6\":\"575.9870\"},{\"1\":\"India\",\"2\":\"Asia\",\"3\":\"1957\",\"4\":\"40.24900\",\"5\":\"409000000\",\"6\":\"590.0620\"},{\"1\":\"United States\",\"2\":\"Americas\",\"3\":\"1957\",\"4\":\"69.49000\",\"5\":\"171984000\",\"6\":\"14847.1271\"},{\"1\":\"Japan\",\"2\":\"Asia\",\"3\":\"1957\",\"4\":\"65.50000\",\"5\":\"91563009\",\"6\":\"4317.6944\"},{\"1\":\"Indonesia\",\"2\":\"Asia\",\"3\":\"1957\",\"4\":\"39.91800\",\"5\":\"90124000\",\"6\":\"858.9003\"},{\"1\":\"Germany\",\"2\":\"Europe\",\"3\":\"1957\",\"4\":\"69.10000\",\"5\":\"71019069\",\"6\":\"10187.8267\"},{\"1\":\"Brazil\",\"2\":\"Americas\",\"3\":\"1957\",\"4\":\"53.28500\",\"5\":\"65551171\",\"6\":\"2487.3660\"},{\"1\":\"United Kingdom\",\"2\":\"Europe\",\"3\":\"1957\",\"4\":\"70.42000\",\"5\":\"51430000\",\"6\":\"11283.1779\"},{\"1\":\"Bangladesh\",\"2\":\"Asia\",\"3\":\"1957\",\"4\":\"39.34800\",\"5\":\"51365468\",\"6\":\"661.6375\"},{\"1\":\"Italy\",\"2\":\"Europe\",\"3\":\"1957\",\"4\":\"67.81000\",\"5\":\"49182000\",\"6\":\"6248.6562\"}],\"options\":{\"columns\":{\"min\":{},\"max\":[10]},\"rows\":{\"min\":[10],\"max\":[10]},\"pages\":{}}}\n  </script>\n</div>\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\nGreat work! A lot of the exercises in this course will involve combining multiple steps with the `%>%` operator.\n\n## The mutate verb\n\nTheory. Coming soon ...\n\n**1. The mutate verb**\n\nYou've already learned two verbs for manipulating data: filter for extracting a subset of the observations, and arrange for sorting them. Suppose\n\n**2. The mutate verb**\n\nyou want to change one of the variables in your dataset, based on the other ones. Or suppose you want to add a new variable. For that, you would use the mutate verb. First you'll learn how to change an existing variable.\n\n**3. Using mutate to change a variable**\n\nYou use mutate like you would filter or arrange, after a pipe operator. Inside this mutate statement, what's on the right of the equals sign is what's being calculated, and what's on the left is what's being replaced. Here, you're calculating pop slash one million. The slash in R performs division, so \"population divided by one million\". On the left, you're saying you want to replace the existing pop column, by writing pop equals.The result is the same table, but with pop replaced with a new value, one that's much smaller than it was before. This is how you manipulate existing variables in the table. That's often necessary during data processing and cleaning.Just like filter and arrange, you're not altering the original gapminder data, you're just changing the value in this new data frame that's being returned. Alternatively,\n\n**4. Using mutate to add a new variable**\n\nyou may want to add a new variable. For instance, you  currently have the GDP per capita: that's the Gross Domestic Product of the country divided by the current population. But in your analysis, you may want to know the total GDP. You'd have to multiply the population by the GDP per capita to find this.You would use mutate in almost the same way. You pipe your gapminder data to the mutate verb. The asterisk in R represents multiplication, so you write gdpPercap asterisk pop to multiply the two columns. Notice that to be informative, we have named the column gdp, that's what's to the left of the equals sign in our code. Column names need to be one word like this: you can't use spaces.Notice that in the results, there's a brand new gdp column, which is much larger than the gdp per capita.\n\n**5. Combining verbs**\n\nLet's put together the three verbs you learned in this chapter to answer a question about our data. Suppose we wanted to know the countries with the highest total GDP in the year 2007. We would do this in three steps- create the column, filter for 2007, then sort.We use mutate to create the total GDP column. Then we'd use filter to restrict our analysis to only the year 2007. Then we'd use arrange to sort the data in descending order of our new GDP variable.This gives us the answer we're looking for. The United States was the country with the highest total GDP in 2007, with a GDP of 13 trillion dollars. The US is followed by China, Japan, India, and Germany as the highest GDP countries.Once you become comfortable with dplyr, you'll be able to find answers like these, and answer much more complicated questions, on your own data.\n\n## Using mutate to change or create a column\n\nSuppose we want life expectancy to be measured in months instead of years: you'd have to multiply the existing value by 12. You can use the `mutate()` verb to change this column, or to create a new column that's calculated this way.\n\n\n**Steps**\n\n1. Use `mutate()` to change the existing `lifeExp` column, by multiplying it by 12: `12 * lifeExp`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Use mutate to change lifeExp to be in months\ngapminder %>% \n  mutate(lifeExp = 12 * lifeExp)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<div data-pagedtable=\"false\">\n  <script data-pagedtable-source type=\"application/json\">\n{\"columns\":[{\"label\":[\"country\"],\"name\":[1],\"type\":[\"fct\"],\"align\":[\"left\"]},{\"label\":[\"continent\"],\"name\":[2],\"type\":[\"fct\"],\"align\":[\"left\"]},{\"label\":[\"year\"],\"name\":[3],\"type\":[\"int\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]},{\"label\":[\"lifeExp\"],\"name\":[4],\"type\":[\"dbl\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]},{\"label\":[\"pop\"],\"name\":[5],\"type\":[\"int\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]},{\"label\":[\"gdpPercap\"],\"name\":[6],\"type\":[\"dbl\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]}],\"data\":[{\"1\":\"Afghanistan\",\"2\":\"Asia\",\"3\":\"1952\",\"4\":\"345.612\",\"5\":\"8425333\",\"6\":\"779.4453\"},{\"1\":\"Afghanistan\",\"2\":\"Asia\",\"3\":\"1957\",\"4\":\"363.984\",\"5\":\"9240934\",\"6\":\"820.8530\"},{\"1\":\"Afghanistan\",\"2\":\"Asia\",\"3\":\"1962\",\"4\":\"383.964\",\"5\":\"10267083\",\"6\":\"853.1007\"},{\"1\":\"Afghanistan\",\"2\":\"Asia\",\"3\":\"1967\",\"4\":\"408.240\",\"5\":\"11537966\",\"6\":\"836.1971\"},{\"1\":\"Afghanistan\",\"2\":\"Asia\",\"3\":\"1972\",\"4\":\"433.056\",\"5\":\"13079460\",\"6\":\"739.9811\"},{\"1\":\"Afghanistan\",\"2\":\"Asia\",\"3\":\"1977\",\"4\":\"461.256\",\"5\":\"14880372\",\"6\":\"786.1134\"},{\"1\":\"Afghanistan\",\"2\":\"Asia\",\"3\":\"1982\",\"4\":\"478.248\",\"5\":\"12881816\",\"6\":\"978.0114\"},{\"1\":\"Afghanistan\",\"2\":\"Asia\",\"3\":\"1987\",\"4\":\"489.864\",\"5\":\"13867957\",\"6\":\"852.3959\"},{\"1\":\"Afghanistan\",\"2\":\"Asia\",\"3\":\"1992\",\"4\":\"500.088\",\"5\":\"16317921\",\"6\":\"649.3414\"},{\"1\":\"Afghanistan\",\"2\":\"Asia\",\"3\":\"1997\",\"4\":\"501.156\",\"5\":\"22227415\",\"6\":\"635.3414\"}],\"options\":{\"columns\":{\"min\":{},\"max\":[10]},\"rows\":{\"min\":[10],\"max\":[10]},\"pages\":{}}}\n  </script>\n</div>\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\n2.

Notice how you can combine several `dplyr` operations to answer a more complicated question like this.\n\n# 2. Data visualization\n\nOften a better way to understand and present data as a graph. In this chapter, you'll learn the essential skills of data visualization using the ggplot2 package, and you'll see how the dplyr and ggplot2 packages work closely together to create informative graphs.\n\n## Visualizing with ggplot2\n\nTheory. Coming soon ...\n\n**1. Visualizing with ggplot2**\n\nIn the last chapter, you used the dplyr package to answer some questions about the gapminder dataset. You've been able to filter for particular observations, arrange to find the highest or lowest values, and mutate to add new columns.However, so far you've engaged with the results only as a table printed out from your code. Often a better way to understand and present this kind of data is as a graph.\n\n**2. Data visualization**\n\nIn this chapter, you'll learn the essential skill of data visualization using the ggplot2 package. In particular, this chapter will show you how to create scatterplots, like the one you see here, that compare two variables on an x- and y- axis.Visualization and data wrangling are often intertwined, so you'll see how the dplyr and ggplot2 packages work closely together to create informative graphs.\n\n**3. Variable Assignment**\n\nIn this chapter, you'll mostly be visualizing subsets of the gapminder dataset. For example, you'll often be visualizing only data from 2007. When you're working with just that subset, it's useful to save the filtered data, as a new data frame.To do this, you use the assignment operator. This is a less then and a minus sign, like an arrow facing to the left. In this operation, you're taking the gapminder dataset, filtering it for the observations from the year 2007, and then saving it- with that arrow going to the left- into a dataset called gapminder underscore 2007.Now if you print the gapminder_2007 dataset, we can see that it's another table. But this one has only 142 rows, and they come only from the year 2007. Now that you've saved this variable, you can use it to create our visualization.\n\n**4. Visualizing with ggplot2**\n\nSuppose you want to examine the relationship between a country's wealth and its life expectancy. You could do this with a scatterplot comparing two variables in our gapminder dataset: GDP per capita on the X axis and life expectancy on the y-axis.You'll be creating this plot using the ggplot2 package. Just like the gapminder and dplyr packages, you'll have to load it with library parentheses ggplot2 end parentheses first.This is the code to create this scatterplot. There are three parts to a ggplot graph. First is the data that we're visualizing. In this case, that is the gapminder_2007 variable you just created.Second is the mapping of variables in your dataset to aesthetics in your graph. An aesthetic is a visual dimension of a graph that can be used to communicate information. In a scatterplot, your two dimensions are the x axis and the y axis, so you write aes (for \"aesthetic\"), parentheses, x equals gdpPerCap, y = lifeExp, telling it which variables to place on which axes.The third step is specifying the type of graph you're creating. You do that by adding a layer to the graph: use a plus after the ggplot, and then geom underscore point. The \"geom\" means you're adding a type of geometric object to the graph, the \"point\" indicates it's a scatter plot, where each observation corresponds to one point. Together, these three parts of the code- the data, the aesthetic mapping, and the layer- construct the scatter plot you see here.In the exercises, you'll practice creating other scatter plots to compare variables across countries, and in the rest of this chapter you'll learn more ways to communicate information in a graph.\n\n## Variable assignment\n\nThroughout the exercises in this chapter, you'll be visualizing a subset of the gapminder data from the year 1952. First, you'll have to load the ggplot2 package, and create a `gapminder_1952` dataset to visualize.\n\n*By the way, if you haven't downloaded it already, check out the <a href=\"https://datacamp-community-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/c1fae72f-d2d7-4646-9dce-dd0f8fb5c5e8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">tidyverse for beginners Cheat Sheet</a>. It includes an overview of the most important concepts, functions and methods and might come in handy if you ever need a quick refresher!*\n\n**Steps**\n\n1. Load the `ggplot2` package after the gapminder and dplyr packages.\n2. Filter `gapminder` for observations from the year 1952, and assign it to a new dataset `gapminder_1952` using the assignment operator (`<-`).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Load the ggplot2 package as well\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n# Create gapminder_1952\ngapminder_1952 <- gapminder %>%\n                    filter(year == 1952)\n```\n:::\n\n\nGreat! If you typed `gapminder_1952` now, you'd see the filtered dataset.\n\n## Comparing population and GDP per capita\n\nIn the video you learned to create a scatter plot with GDP per capita on the x-axis and life expectancy on the y-axis (the code for that graph has been provided in the exercise code). When you're exploring data visually, you'll often need to try different combinations of variables and aesthetics.\n\n**Steps**\n\n1. Change the scatter plot of `gapminder_1952` so that (`pop`) is on the x-axis and GDP per capita (`gdpPercap`) is on the y-axis.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Change to put pop on the x-axis and gdpPercap on the y-axis\nggplot(gapminder_1952, aes(x = pop, y = gdpPercap)) +\n  geom_point()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](03_programming_tidyverse_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nGreat work on your first graph! Each point represents a country: can you guess which country any of the points are?\n\n## Comparing population and life expectancy\n\nIn this exercise, you'll use `ggplot2` to create a scatter plot from scratch, to compare each country's population with its life expectancy in the year 1952.\n\n**Steps**\n\n1. Create a scatter plot of `gapminder_1952` with population (`pop`) is on the x-axis and life expectancy (`lifeExp`) on the y-axis.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Create a scatter plot with pop on the x-axis and lifeExp on the y-axis\nggplot(gapminder_1952, aes(x = pop, y = lifeExp)) +\n  geom_point()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](03_programming_tidyverse_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nGreat! You might notice the points are crowded towards the left side of the plot, making them hard to distinguish. This next video will help solve that problem.\n\n## Log scales\n\nTheory. Coming soon ...\n\n## Putting the x-axis on a log scale\n\nYou previously created a scatter plot with population on the x-axis and life expectancy on the y-axis. Since population is spread over several orders of magnitude, with some countries having a much higher population than others, it's a good idea to put the x-axis on a log scale.\n\n**Steps**\n\n1. Change the existing scatter plot (code provided) to put the x-axis (representing population) on a log scale.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Change this plot to put the x-axis on a log scale\nggplot(gapminder_1952, aes(x = pop, y = lifeExp)) +\n  geom_point() + \n  scale_x_log10()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](03_programming_tidyverse_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-15-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nGreat! Notice the points are more spread out on the x-axis. This makes it easy to see that there isn't a correlation between population and life expectancy.\n\n## Putting the x- and y- axes on a log scale\n\nSuppose you want to create a scatter plot with population on the x-axis and GDP per capita on the y-axis. Both population and GDP per-capita are better represented with log scales, since they vary over many orders of magnitude.\n\n**Steps**\n\n1. Create a scatter plot with population (`pop`) on the x-axis and GDP per capita (`gdpPercap`) on the y-axis. Put **both** the x- and y- axes on a log scale.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Scatter plot comparing pop and gdpPercap, with both axes on a log scale\nggplot(gapminder_1952, aes(x = pop, y = gdpPercap)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  scale_x_log10() + \n  scale_y_log10()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](03_programming_tidyverse_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-16-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nGreat! Notice that the y-axis goes from 1e3 (1000) to 1e4 (10,000) to 1e5 (100,000) in equal increments.\n\n## Additional aesthetics\n\nTheory. Coming soon ...\n\n**1. Additional aesthetics**\n\nYou've learned how to create a scatter plot to compare\n\n**2. Scatter plots**\n\ntwo variables within your data using two visual aesthetics: GDP per capita on the x-axis, and life expectancy on the y-axis. But\n\n**3. Additional variables**\n\nthese aren't the only variables in the gapminder dataset: for example, you also have continent and population. You may want to examine relationships among all these variables in the same plot. You already used the x-axis to represent GDP per capita and the y-axis to represent life expectancy. Now you'll learn to add two more aesthetics- color and size- to communicate even more information in your scatter plot. Continent is a categorical variable: it has a few specific values, such as Asia and Europe. A good way to represent a categorical variable in a scatterplot\n\n**4. The color aesthetic**\n\nis the color of your points, like you see here. To use this aesthetic, you add color equals continent inside the aes, next to x equals gdpPercap and y equals life expectancy. The code is otherwise the same, including the plus geom_point and the + scale x log10. Notice that that ggplot2 automatically adds a legend to the plot, indicating which color represents which continent. This communicates a lot about differences between continents. The average life expectancy and GDP per capita tends to be lowest for African countries, shown in red, and highest for European countries, shown in blue. Another variable you may want to include in the graph is population, represented by the pop variable in the dataset. This is a numeric variable, so a good way to represent it is with the size\n\n**5. The size aesthestic**\n\nof the points in the scatterplot, with higher population countries getting larger points. Just like x, y, and color, you add size = pop within the aes parentheses. Note that to keep the length of each of the code lines reasonable, we put the size aesthetic on a second line, but this doesn't make any difference, and you don't have to do that in the exercises.\n\n**6. Aesthetics**\n\nYou've now learned to use four aesthetics in a plot: x, y, color, and size: to communicate information about four variables in your dataset. In the exercises,\n\n**7. Let's practice!**\n\nyou'll learn to mix and match aesthetics and variables to further explore the statistical state of the world within one year. \n\n## Adding color to a scatter plot\n\nIn this lesson you learned how to use the color aesthetic, which can be used to show which continent each point in a scatter plot represents.\n\n**Steps**\n\n1. Create a scatter plot with population (`pop`) on the x-axis, life expectancy (`lifeExp`) on the y-axis, and with continent (`continent`) represented by the color of the points. Put the x-axis on a log scale.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Scatter plot comparing pop and lifeExp, with color representing continent\nggplot(gapminder_1952, aes(x = pop, y = lifeExp, color = continent)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  scale_x_log10() +\n  scale_y_log10()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](03_programming_tidyverse_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-17-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nGood work! What differences can you see between continents, in terms of their population and life expectancy?\n\n## Adding size and color to a plot\n\nIn the last exercise, you created a scatter plot communicating information about each country's population, life expectancy, and continent. Now you'll use the size of the points to communicate even more.\n\n**Steps**\n\n1. Modify the scatter plot so that the size of the points represents each country's GDP per capita (`gdpPercap`).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Add the size aesthetic to represent a country's gdpPercap\nggplot(gapminder_1952, aes(x = pop, y = lifeExp, color = continent, size = gdpPercap)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  scale_x_log10()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](03_programming_tidyverse_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-18-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nGood work! Are you able to guess which point represents your own country?\n\n## Faceting\n\nTheory. Coming soon ...\n\n**1. Faceting**\n\nYou've learned to use color\n\n**2. Plot Life Expectancy vs GDP**\n\nto distinguish the five continents within your scatterplot. Now you'll learn about another way to explore your data in terms of this kind of categorical variable.\n\n**3. Faceting**\n\nggplot2 lets you divide your plot into subplots to get one smaller graph for each continent: Africa, the Americas, and so on. This is called faceting, and it's another powerful way to communicate relationships within your data. You facet a plot by adding another option, with a +, to the end of your code, after geom_point and scale_x_log10. You add facet underscore wrap, then \"tilde continent\" within the parentheses. In R, the tilde symbol typically means \"by\", meaning that we're splitting the plot by continent, and you can usually find it on the upper left of your keyboard. This tells ggplot2 to divide the data into subplots based on the continent variable. Faceting is a powerful tool, and in\n\n**4. Faceting Plots**\n\nthe exercises you'll see how you can use faceting not just to compare among continents, but to compare between all of the years in our dataset.\n\n## Creating a subgraph for each continent\n\nYou've learned to use faceting to divide a graph into subplots based on one of its variables, such as the continent.\n\n**Steps**\n\n1. Create a scatter plot of `gapminder_1952` with the x-axis representing population (`pop`), the y-axis representing life expectancy (`lifeExp`), and faceted to have one subplot per continent (`continent`). Put the x-axis on a log scale.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Scatter plot comparing pop and lifeExp, faceted by continent\nggplot(gapminder_1952, aes(x = pop, y = lifeExp)) +\n  geom_point() + \n  scale_x_log10() + \n  facet_wrap(~ continent)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](03_programming_tidyverse_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-19-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nGreat work! Faceting is a powerful way to understand subsets of your data separately.\n\n## Faceting by year\n\nAll of the graphs in this chapter have been visualizing statistics within one year. Now that you're able to use faceting, however, you can create a graph showing **all** the country-level data from 1952 to 2007, to understand how global statistics have changed over time.\n\n**Steps**\n\n1. Create a scatter plot of the `gapminder` data:\n2. Put GDP per capita (`gdpPercap`) on the x-axis and life expectancy (`lifeExp`) on the y-axis, with continent (`continent`) represented by color and population (`pop`) represented by size.\n3. Put the x-axis on a log scale\n4. Facet by the `year` variable\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Scatter plot comparing gdpPercap and lifeExp, with color representing continent\n# and size representing population, faceted by year\nggplot(gapminder, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, color = continent, size = pop)) + \n  geom_point() +\n  scale_x_log10() + \n  facet_wrap(~ year)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](03_programming_tidyverse_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-20-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAwesome! That's a lot of information you're now able to share in one graph.\n\n# 3. Grouping and summarizing\n\nSo far you've been answering questions about individual country-year pairs, but you may be interested in aggregations of the data, such as the average life expectancy of all countries within each year. Here you'll learn to use the group by and summarize verbs, which collapse large datasets into manageable summaries.\n\n## The summarize verb\n\nTheory. Coming soon ...\n\n**1. The summarize verb**\n\nIn this chapter, you'll return to the topic of data transformation with dplyr to learn more ways to explore your data.\n\n**2. Data transformation and visualization**\n\nAnalyses will usually involve a cycle between these steps of data transformation and visualization, as well as additional components of the data science workflow, like modeling, that you'll learn about in other DataCamp courses.Once you've learned these new verbs, you'll be able to create a much larger variety of informative visualizations with ggplot2. You've learned to use the\n\n**3. Extracting data**\n\nfilter verb to pull out individual observations, such as statistics for the United States in 2007. Now you'll learn how to summarize many observations into a single data point.\n\n**4. The summarize verb**\n\nFor example, suppose you want to know the average life expectancy across all countries and years in the dataset.You would do this with the summarize verb. Take your gapminder data, pipe it into summarize, and specify that you're creating a summary column called meanLifeExp. The \"mean parentheses lifeexp end parentheses\" there is worth examining. This is calling the function mean on the variable lifeExp. The mean function takes the average of a set of values, and R comes with many built-in functions like this.Notice that summarize collapses the entire table down into one row. In the output, we see the answer to our question: the mean life expectancy was about 59.47 years.If you think about it, it doesn't really make sense to summarize across all countries and across all years. It may make more sense to ask questions about averages in a particular year, such as 2007.\n\n**5. Summarizing one year**\n\nTo answer this, you can combine the summarize verb with filter: filter your data for a particular year first, then summarize the result. This shows you that the average life expectancy in the year 2007 was about 67 years. You can create multiple summaries at once with the summarize verb.\n\n**6. Summarizing into multiple columns**\n\nFor example, suppose that along with finding the average life expectancy in 2007, you want to find the total population in that year.To do that, you add a comma after the mean of the life expectancy, and specify another column that you're creating. You could give it a useful name like totalPop, and say that it's equal to the sum- that's another built-in function- of the pop variable.\n\n**7. Functions you can use for summarizing**\n\nmean and sum are just two of the built-in functions you could use to summarize a variable within a dataset. Another example is median: the median represents the point in a set of numbers where half the numbers are above that point and half of the numbers are below. Two others are min, for minimum, and max, for maximum. In the exercises, you'll use several of these functions to answer questions about the gapminder dataset.\n\n## Summarizing the median life expectancy\n\nYou've seen how to find the mean life expectancy and the total population across a set of observations, but `mean()` and `sum()` are only two of the functions R provides for summarizing a collection of numbers. Here, you'll learn to use the `median()` function in combination with `summarize()`.\n\nBy the way, `dplyr` displays some messages when it's loaded that we've been hiding so far. They'll show up in red and start with:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(dplyr)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nThe following object is masked from 'package:ggplot2':\n\n    vars\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nThis will occur in future exercises each time you load `dplyr`: it's mentioning some built-in functions that are overwritten by `dplyr`. You won't need to worry about this message within this course.\n\n**Steps**\n\n1. Use the `median()` function within a `summarize()` to find the median life expectancy. Save it into a column called `medianLifeExp`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Summarize to find the median life expectancy\ngapminder %>% \n    summarize(medianLifeExp = median(lifeExp))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<div data-pagedtable=\"false\">\n  <script data-pagedtable-source type=\"application/json\">\n{\"columns\":[{\"label\":[\"medianLifeExp\"],\"name\":[1],\"type\":[\"dbl\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]}],\"data\":[{\"1\":\"60.7125\"}],\"options\":{\"columns\":{\"min\":{},\"max\":[10]},\"rows\":{\"min\":[10],\"max\":[10]},\"pages\":{}}}\n  </script>\n</div>\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThat's right! Note that this is the median across all countries and all years in the dataset.\n\n## Summarizing the median life expectancy in 1957\n\nRather than summarizing the entire dataset, you may want to find the median life expectancy for only one particular year. In this case, you'll find the median in the year 1957.\n\n**Steps**\n\n1. Filter for the year 1957, then use the `median()` function within a `summarize()` to calculate the median life expectancy into a column called `medianLifeExp`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Filter for 1957 then summarize the median life expectancy\ngapminder %>% \n  filter(year == 1957) %>%\n  summarize(medianLifeExp = median(lifeExp))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<div data-pagedtable=\"false\">\n  <script data-pagedtable-source type=\"application/json\">\n{\"columns\":[{\"label\":[\"medianLifeExp\"],\"name\":[1],\"type\":[\"dbl\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]}],\"data\":[{\"1\":\"48.3605\"}],\"options\":{\"columns\":{\"min\":{},\"max\":[10]},\"rows\":{\"min\":[10],\"max\":[10]},\"pages\":{}}}\n  </script>\n</div>\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\nGreat! Just like in Chapter 1, this chapter will often involve performing multiple `dplyr` steps in a row.\n\n## Summarizing multiple variables in 1957\n\nThe `summarize()` verb allows you to summarize multiple variables at once. In this case, you'll use the `median()` function to find the median life expectancy and the `max()` function to find the maximum GDP per capita.\n\n**Steps**\n\n1. Find both the median life expectancy (`lifeExp`) and the maximum GDP per capita (`gdpPercap`) in the year 1957, calling them `medianLifeExp` and `maxGdpPercap` respectively. You can use the `max()` function to find the maximum.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Filter for 1957 then summarize the median life expectancy and the maximum GDP per capita\ngapminder %>% \n  filter(year == 1957) %>%\n  summarize(medianLifeExp = median(lifeExp), \n            maxGdpPercap  = max(gdpPercap))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<div data-pagedtable=\"false\">\n  <script data-pagedtable-source type=\"application/json\">\n{\"columns\":[{\"label\":[\"medianLifeExp\"],\"name\":[1],\"type\":[\"dbl\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]},{\"label\":[\"maxGdpPercap\"],\"name\":[2],\"type\":[\"dbl\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]}],\"data\":[{\"1\":\"48.3605\",\"2\":\"113523.1\"}],\"options\":{\"columns\":{\"min\":{},\"max\":[10]},\"rows\":{\"min\":[10],\"max\":[10]},\"pages\":{}}}\n  </script>\n</div>\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThat's right! Think about what other kinds of information about countries you might want to summarize within one year.\n\n## The group_by verb\n\nTheory. Coming soon ...\n\n**1. The group_by verb**\n\nIn the last set of exercises, you learned to use the\n\n**2. The summarize verb**\n\nsummarize verb to answer questions about the entire dataset, or about a particular year. For example, here you're finding the average life expectancy and the total population in the year 2007. What if we weren't interested just in the average for the year 2007, but for each of the years in the dataset? You could rerun this code and change the year each time, but that's very tedious. Instead, you can use the group_by verb, which tells dplyr to summarize within groups instead of summarizing the entire dataset.\n\n**3. Summarizing by year**\n\nNotice that this replaces the filter year equals 2007 with group_by year. group_by(year) tells the summarize step that it should perform the summary within each year: within 1952, then within 1957, then within 1962, and combine the results. Instead of getting one row overall, you now get one row for each year. There's now a year variable along with the new meanLifeExp and totalPop variables. This shows us that the total population started at 2-point-4 billion, and went up to 6-point-25 billion in 2007. We can also see that average life expectancy went up from 49 years in 1952 to 67. You can summarize by other variables besides year. Suppose you're\n\n**4. Summarizing by continent**\n\ninterested in the average life expectancy and the total population in 2007 within each continent. You can find this by first filtering for the year 2007, grouping by continent (instead of year), and then performing your summary. This results in a table with one row for each continent, with columns for mean life expectancy and total population. We can see that Europe and Oceania have the highest life expectancy, and that Asia and Africa are lower. Now that you've calculated these statistics for each continent in 2007, you might be interested in how they changed for each continent over time.\n\n**5. Summarizing by continent and year**\n\nTo do so, you can summarize by both year and continent, by adding year comma continent within the group by. Now the output has one row for each combination of a year and continent. For example, we see the total population and average life expectancy in 1952 for Africa, the Americas, Asia, Europe, and Oceania, followed by each of the continent-level summaries for 1957. In the next video, you'll learn how to visualize this per-year, per-continent data to understand trends over time. \n\n## Summarizing by year\n\nIn a previous exercise, you found the median life expectancy and the maximum GDP per capita in the year 1957. Now, you'll perform those two summaries within each year in the dataset, using the `group_by` verb.\n\n**Steps**\n\n1. Find the median life expectancy (`lifeExp`) and maximum GDP per capita (`gdpPercap`) **within each year**, saving them into `medianLifeExp` and `maxGdpPercap`, respectively.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Find median life expectancy and maximum GDP per capita in each year\ngapminder %>% \n  group_by(year) %>%\n  summarize(medianLifeExp = median(lifeExp), \n            maxGdpPercap  = max(gdpPercap))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<div data-pagedtable=\"false\">\n  <script data-pagedtable-source type=\"application/json\">\n{\"columns\":[{\"label\":[\"year\"],\"name\":[1],\"type\":[\"int\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]},{\"label\":[\"medianLifeExp\"],\"name\":[2],\"type\":[\"dbl\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]},{\"label\":[\"maxGdpPercap\"],\"name\":[3],\"type\":[\"dbl\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]}],\"data\":[{\"1\":\"1952\",\"2\":\"45.1355\",\"3\":\"108382.35\"},{\"1\":\"1957\",\"2\":\"48.3605\",\"3\":\"113523.13\"},{\"1\":\"1962\",\"2\":\"50.8810\",\"3\":\"95458.11\"},{\"1\":\"1967\",\"2\":\"53.8250\",\"3\":\"80894.88\"},{\"1\":\"1972\",\"2\":\"56.5300\",\"3\":\"109347.87\"},{\"1\":\"1977\",\"2\":\"59.6720\",\"3\":\"59265.48\"},{\"1\":\"1982\",\"2\":\"62.4415\",\"3\":\"33693.18\"},{\"1\":\"1987\",\"2\":\"65.8340\",\"3\":\"31540.97\"},{\"1\":\"1992\",\"2\":\"67.7030\",\"3\":\"34932.92\"},{\"1\":\"1997\",\"2\":\"69.3940\",\"3\":\"41283.16\"}],\"options\":{\"columns\":{\"min\":{},\"max\":[10]},\"rows\":{\"min\":[10],\"max\":[10]},\"pages\":{}}}\n  </script>\n</div>\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\nGreat! Interesting: notice that median life expectancy across countries is generally going up over time, but maximum GDP per capita is not.\n\n## Summarizing by continent\n\nYou can group by any variable in your dataset to create a summary. Rather than comparing across time, you might be interested in comparing among continents. You'll want to do that within one year of the dataset: let's use 1957.\n\n**Steps**\n\n1. Filter the `gapminder` data for the year 1957. Then find the median life expectancy (`lifeExp`) and maximum GDP per capita (`gdpPercap`) **within each continent**, saving them into `medianLifeExp` and `maxGdpPercap`, respectively.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Find median life expectancy and maximum GDP per capita in each continent in 1957\ngapminder %>%\n  filter(year == 1957) %>%\n  group_by(continent) %>%\n  summarize(medianLifeExp = median(lifeExp), \n            maxGdpPercap  = max(gdpPercap))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<div data-pagedtable=\"false\">\n  <script data-pagedtable-source type=\"application/json\">\n{\"columns\":[{\"label\":[\"continent\"],\"name\":[1],\"type\":[\"fct\"],\"align\":[\"left\"]},{\"label\":[\"medianLifeExp\"],\"name\":[2],\"type\":[\"dbl\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]},{\"label\":[\"maxGdpPercap\"],\"name\":[3],\"type\":[\"dbl\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]}],\"data\":[{\"1\":\"Africa\",\"2\":\"40.5925\",\"3\":\"5487.104\"},{\"1\":\"Americas\",\"2\":\"56.0740\",\"3\":\"14847.127\"},{\"1\":\"Asia\",\"2\":\"48.2840\",\"3\":\"113523.133\"},{\"1\":\"Europe\",\"2\":\"67.6500\",\"3\":\"17909.490\"},{\"1\":\"Oceania\",\"2\":\"70.2950\",\"3\":\"12247.395\"}],\"options\":{\"columns\":{\"min\":{},\"max\":[10]},\"rows\":{\"min\":[10],\"max\":[10]},\"pages\":{}}}\n  </script>\n</div>\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\nGreat work!

In the next chapter, you'll learn to turn this data into an informative graph.\n\n## Visualizing summarized data\n\nTheory. Coming soon ...\n\n**1. Visualizing summarized data**\n\nIn this chapter you learned to use the group by and summarize verbs to summarize the gapminder data by year, by continent, or by both. Now you'll learn how to turn those summaries into informative visualizations, by returning to the ggplot2 package from Chapter 2.\n\n**2. Summarizing by year**\n\nIn the last video we summarized data by year, to find the change in population and in mean life expectancy over time. Now instead of viewing the summarized data as a table, let's save it as an object called by_year, so you can visualize the data using ggplot2. You would\n\n**3. Visualizing population over time**\n\nconstruct the graph with the three steps of ggplot2: the data, which is by_year. The aesthetics, which puts year on the x-axis and total population on the y-axis. And the type of graph, which in this case is a scatter plot, represented by geom_point. Notice that the steps are the same as when you were graphing countries in a scatter plot, even though it's a new dataset. The resulting graph of population by year shows the change in the total population, which is going up over time. ggplot2 puts the y-axis is in scientific notation, since showing it with nine zeros would be hard to read. The global starts a little under 3 times 10 to the 9th power- that's three billion- and goes up to more than 6 billion. You might notice that the graph is a little misleading because it doesn't include zero: you don't have a sense of how much the population grew relative to where it was when it started. This is a good time to introduce another graphing option.\n\n**4. Starting y-axis at zero**\n\nBy adding \"expand underscore limits y = 0\" to the end of the ggplot call, you can specify that you want the y-axis to start at zero. Notice that you added it to the end just like you would with scale_x_log10, or facet_wrap. Now the graph makes it clearer that the population is almost tripling during this time. You could have created other graphs of summarized data, such as a graph of the average life expectancy over time, by changing the y aesthetic. So\n\n**5. Summarizing by year and continent**\n\nfar you've been graphing the by-year summarized data. But you have also learned to summarize after grouping by both year and continent, to see how the changes in population have occurred separately within each continent. Since you now have data over time within each continent, you need a way to separate it in a visualization. To do that you can use the color aesthetic\n\n**6. Visualizing population by year and continent**\n\nyou learned about in chapter two. By setting color equals continent, you can show five separate trends on the same graph. This lets us see that Asia was always the most populated continent and has been growing the most rapidly, that Europe has a slower rate of growth, and that Africa has grown to surpass both Europe and the Americas in terms of population. In Chapter 4 you'll learn to turn these into line plots that are a bit better for presenting data over time. You'll often combine dplyr verbs and ggplot2 visualizations as part of an exploratory analysis, so it's important to get into the habit of visualizing summarized or processed data. \n\n## Visualizing median life expectancy over time\n\nIn the last chapter, you summarized the gapminder data to calculate the median life expectancy within each year. This code is provided for you, and is saved (with `<-`) as the `by_year` dataset.\n\nNow you can use the ggplot2 package to turn this into a visualization of changing life expectancy over time.\n\n**Steps**\n\n1. Use the `by_year` dataset to create a scatter plot showing the change of median life expectancy over time, with `year` on the x-axis and `medianLifeExp` on the y-axis. Be sure to add `expand_limits(y = 0)` to make sure the plot's y-axis includes zero.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nby_year <- gapminder %>%\n  group_by(year) %>%\n  summarize(medianLifeExp = median(lifeExp),\n            maxGdpPercap = max(gdpPercap))\n\n# Create a scatter plot showing the change in medianLifeExp over time\nggplot(by_year, aes(x = year, y = medianLifeExp)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  expand_limits(y = 0)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](03_programming_tidyverse_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-29-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nGreat! It looks like median life expectancy across countries is increasing over time.\n\n## Visualizing median GDP per capita per continent over time\n\nIn the last exercise you were able to see how the median life expectancy of countries changed over time. Now you'll examine the median GDP per capita instead, and see how the trend differs among continents.\n\n**Steps**\n\n1. Summarize the gapminder dataset by continent and year, finding the median GDP per capita (`gdpPercap`) within each and putting it into a column called `medianGdpPercap`.

You'll learn that in Chapter 4!\n\n## Comparing median life expectancy and median GDP per continent in 2007\n\nIn these exercises you've generally created plots that show change over time. But as another way of exploring your data visually, you can also use ggplot2 to plot summarized data to compare continents within a single year.\n\n**Steps**\n\n1. Filter the gapminder dataset for the year 2007, then summarize the median GDP per capita and the median life expectancy **within each continent**, into columns called `medianLifeExp` and `medianGdpPercap`. Save this as `by_continent_2007`.\n2. Use the `by_continent_2007` data to create a scatterplot comparing these summary statistics for continents in 2007, putting the median GDP per capita on the x-axis to the median life expectancy on the y-axis. Color the scatter plot by `continent`. You don't need to add `expand_limits(y = 0)` for this plot.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Summarize the median GDP and median life expectancy per continent in 2007\nby_continent_2007 <- gapminder %>%\n  filter(year == 2007) %>%\n  group_by(continent) %>%\n  summarize(medianGdpPercap = median(gdpPercap),\n            medianLifeExp = median(lifeExp))\n\n# Use a scatter plot to compare the median GDP and median life expectancy\nggplot(by_continent_2007, aes(x = medianGdpPercap, y = medianLifeExp, color = continent)) +\n  geom_point()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](03_programming_tidyverse_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-31-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nGreat work! Scatter plots are a very flexible tool for examining relationships.\n\n# 4. Types of visualizations\n\nIn this chapter, you'll learn how to create line plots, bar plots, histograms, and boxplots. You'll see how each plot requires different methods of data manipulation and preparation, and you’ll understand how each of these plot types plays a different role in data analysis.\n\n## Line plots\n\nTheory. Coming soon ...\n\n**1. Line plots**\n\nThe graphs you've made so far in this course have all been\n\n**2. Life Expectancy vs GDP**\n\nscatter plots, like this one. These are useful for comparing two variables, such as GDP per capita and life expectancy, with each point representing one observation.But there are many other types of graphs you can make with ggplot2, each of which is useful for visualizing a particular type of data. In\n\n**3. Types of plots**\n\nthis chapter, you'll learn to make four more types of graphs.You'll make line plots, which are useful for showing change over time. You'll create bar plots, which are good at comparing statistics for each of several categories. You'll learn to make histograms, which describe the distribution of a one-dimensional numeric variable. And you'll make box plots, which compare the distribution of a numeric variable among several categories.You'll see how the R code to create each is similar to a scatter plot, where you map variables in your data, like life expectancy and GDP, to visual aesthetics, such as x and y. Once you master this approach, you'll be able to visualize your data in many ways besides the ones taught in this course.\n\n**4. Scatter vs line plot**\n\nYou'll start by making a line plot, for visualizing a change over time. In the last chapter, you created a plot like this to show the mean life expectancy in each continent in each year. You can get a sense of the trends from this plot. But it's a bit easier to understand as a line plot, where the observations within each continent are connected. This makes it clearer that what we care about is the upward or downward trend over time.The way you make a line plot is to change one part of the code. geom_point was the part of the code that specified you were making a scatter plot. Simply change that to geom_line to make a line plot. So this is\n\n**5. Line plot**\n\nhow you make a line plot. Most of it looks exactly the same as a scatter plot: provide the data you're plotting, the aesthetics of x, y, and color, and end with expand_limits(y = 0). The only difference is the type of plot: geom underscore line.In the exercises, you'll use code like this to generate several visualizations of change over time.\n\n## Visualizing median GDP per capita over time\n\nA line plot is useful for visualizing trends over time. In this exercise, you'll examine how the median GDP per capita has changed over time.\n\n**Steps**\n\n1. Use `group_by()` and `summarize()` to find the median GDP per capita **within each year**, calling the output column `medianGdpPercap`. Use the assignment operator `\\n\n2. Use the `by_year` dataset to create a line plot showing the change in median GDP per capita over time. **Be sure** to use `expand_limits(y = 0)` to include 0 on the y-axis.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Summarize the median gdpPercap by year, then save it as by_year\nby_year <- gapminder %>%\n  group_by(year) %>%\n  summarize(medianGdpPercap = median(gdpPercap))\n\n# Create a line plot showing the change in medianGdpPercap over time\nggplot(by_year, aes(x = year, y = medianGdpPercap)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  expand_limits(y = 0)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](03_programming_tidyverse_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-32-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nGreat! Looks like median GDP per capita across countries has gone up over time.\n\n## Visualizing median GDP per capita per continent over time\n\nIn the last exercise you were able to see how the median life expectancy of countries changed over time. Now you'll examine the median GDP per capita instead, and see how the trend differs among continents.\n\n**Steps**\n\n1. Summarize the gapminder dataset by continent and year, finding the median GDP per capita (`gdpPercap`) within each and putting it into a column called `medianGdpPercap`. Use the assignment operator `<-` to save this summarized data as `by_year_continent`.\n2. Create a scatter plot showing the change in `medianGdpPercap` by continent over time. Use color to distinguish between continents, and be sure to add `expand_limits(y = 0)` so that the y-axis starts at zero.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Summarize medianGdpPercap within each continent within each year: by_year_continent\nby_year_continent <- gapminder %>%\n  group_by(continent, year) %>%\n  summarize(medianGdpPercap = median(gdpPercap))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'continent'.

Take a look at the plot: did the growth in median GDP per capita differ between continents?\n\n## Bar plots\n\nTheory. Coming soon ...\n\n**1. Bar plots**\n\nThe next kind of plot you'll learn to make is a bar plot. Bar plots are useful for comparing values across discrete categories, such as continents.\n\n**2. Summarizing by continent**\n\nIn the last chapter, you learned to calculate summarized values within groups. For example, this code finds the average life expectancy within each continent in the year 2007. That creates a table that looks like this, with one observation for each continent.Instead of just printing the table, you might want to represent the summary visually. For that, you would use a\n\n**3. Bar plot**\n\nbar plot. This kind of plot represents the data using one bar for each continent, with the height of the bar representing the mean life expectancy.To create a bar plot, you use geom underscore col, short for \"column\". There are two aesthetics in a bar plot. X is the categorical variable: in this case, the continent. Y is the variable that determines the height of the bars: the mean life expectancy. This makes it easy to see which continents have higher life expectancy than others.Notice that unlike scatter plots or line plots, bar plots always start at zero.\n\n**4. Let's practice!**\n\nIn the exercises, you'll summarize other statistics within each continent, and then use bar plots to compare them visually.\n\n## Visualizing median GDP per capita by continent\n\nA bar plot is useful for visualizing summary statistics, such as the median GDP in each continent.\n\n**Steps**\n\n1. Use `group_by()` and `summarize()` to find the median GDP per capita **within each continent** in the year 1952, calling the output column `medianGdpPercap`. Use the assignment operator `<-` to save it to a dataset called `by_continent`.\n2. Use the `by_continent` dataset to create a bar plot showing the median GDP per capita in each continent.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Summarize the median gdpPercap by year and continent in 1952\nby_continent <- gapminder %>%\n  filter(year == 1952) %>%\n  group_by(continent) %>%\n  summarize(medianGdpPercap = median(gdpPercap))\n\n# Create a bar plot showing medianGdp by continent\nggplot(by_continent, aes(x = continent, y = medianGdpPercap)) + \n  geom_col()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](03_programming_tidyverse_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-37-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nExcellent! That's three kinds of plots you're now able to make with ggplot2.\n\n## Visualizing GDP per capita by country in Oceania\n\nYou've created a plot where each bar represents one continent, showing the median GDP per capita for each. But the x-axis of the bar plot doesn't have to be the continent: you can instead create a bar plot where each bar represents a country.\n\nIn this exercise, you'll create a bar plot comparing the GDP per capita between the two countries in the Oceania continent (Australia and New Zealand).\n\n**Steps**\n\n1. Filter for observations in the **Oceania** continent in the year 1952. Save this as `oceania_1952`.\n2. Use the `oceania_1952` dataset to create a bar plot, with country on the x-axis and `gdpPercap` on the y-axis.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Filter for observations in the Oceania continent in 1952\noceania_1952 <- gapminder %>%\n  filter(year == 1952, continent == \"Oceania\")\n  \n# Create a bar plot of gdpPercap by country\nggplot(oceania_1952, aes(x = country, y = gdpPercap)) +\n  geom_col()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](03_programming_tidyverse_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-38-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nGood work! Looks like the GDP per capita of these two countries was similar in 1952.\n\n## Histograms\n\nTheory. Coming soon ...\n\n**1. Histograms**\n\nEach kind of graph offers a different way to investigate your data. So far we've been looking at relationships between two or more variables. But we can instead investigate one dimension of the data at a time, using a histogram.\n\n**2. Histogram**\n\nA histogram shows a distribution. In this case, it's the distribution of life expectancy across countries in the year 2007. Every bar represents a bin of life expectancies, and the height represents how many countries fall into that bin. This lets you get a sense of the distribution based on the histogram's shape. We can see that most countries have a life expectancy between 70 to 80 years, but that another set of countries have life expectancies between 40 and 65.A histogram is created with geom underscore histogram. It has only one aesthetic: the x-axis, the variable whose distribution you are examining.The width of each bin in the histogram is chosen automatically, and it has a large effect on how the histogram communicates the distribution. You may need to customize that width. You can\n\n**3. Adjusting bin width**\n\ndo so with the binwidth option, which is set inside the parentheses of the geom underscore histogram layer. Setting binwidth equals 5 means that each of the bars in the histograms represents a width of five years. Setting a wide binwidth like this makes the histogram a bit blockier, which focuses on the general shape more than the small details. As you gain experience with histograms, you'll learn how to customize this to give the clearest picture of your data. In some cases, you may need to put the x-axis of a histogram on a log scale for it to be understandable, just like you did in several of the scatter plots in Chapter 2.\n\n**4. Log x-axis**\n\nRecall that you do this by adding a scale underscore x underscore log10 to the graph. You'll practice doing so in the exercises.\n\n## Visualizing population\n\nA histogram is useful for examining the distribution of a numeric variable. In this exercise, you'll create a histogram showing the distribution of country populations (by millions) in the year 1952.\n\nCode for generating this dataset, `gapminder_1952`, is provided.\n\n**Steps**\n\n1. Use the `gapminder_1952` dataset to create a histogram of country population (`pop_by_mil`) in the year 1952. Inside the histogram geom, set the number of `bins` to `50`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngapminder_1952 <- gapminder %>%\n  filter(year == 1952) %>%\n  mutate(pop_by_mil = pop / 1000000)\n\n# Create a histogram of population (pop_by_mil)\nggplot(gapminder_1952, aes(x = pop_by_mil)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins = 50)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](03_programming_tidyverse_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-39-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThat's right! Notice that most of the distribution is in the smallest (leftmost) bins. In the next exercise you'll put the x-axis on a log scale.\n\n## Visualizing population with x-axis on a log scale\n\nIn the last exercise you created a histogram of populations across countries. You might have noticed that there were several countries with a much higher population than others, which causes the distribution to be very skewed, with most of the distribution crammed into a small part of the graph. (Consider that it's hard to tell the median or the minimum population from that histogram).\n\nTo make the histogram more informative, you can try putting the x-axis on a log scale.\n\n**Steps**\n\n1. Use the `gapminder_1952` dataset (code is provided) to create a histogram of country population (`pop`) in the year 1952, putting the x-axis on a log scale with `scale_x_log10()`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngapminder_1952 <- gapminder %>%\n  filter(year == 1952)\n\n# Create a histogram of population (pop), with x on a log scale\nggplot(gapminder_1952, aes(x = pop)) +\n  geom_histogram() +\n  scale_x_log10()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](03_programming_tidyverse_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-40-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nGreat! Notice that on a log scale, the distribution of country populations is approximately symmetrical.\n\n## Boxplots\n\nTheory. Coming soon ...\n\n**1. Box plots**\n\nIn this final lesson, you'll learn how to make one more type of graph: a box plot. Recall that we used\n\n**2. Histograms**\n\na histogram when we wanted to examine the distribution of one variable, such as life expectancy, across all countries. Notice that a histogram combines all the life expectancies across all continents, without distinguishing them. But what if your goal is to compare the distribution of life expectancies among continents?\n\n**3. Box plots**\n\nThis is a box plot, which shows the distribution of life expectancies within each continent, so that you can compare them. It is created with geom underscore boxplot, and it has two aesthetics- x is the category (continent), and y is the values that we're comparing, which in this case is life expectancy. A box plot takes a bit of practice to interpret, so here's what each of the components means. The black line in the middle of each white box is the median of that continent's distribution. The top and bottom of each box represent the 75th percentile and the 25th percentile of that group, meaning half of the distribution lies within that box. The lines going up and down from the box, called \"whiskers\", cover additional countries. The two dots below the whiskers for Asia and the Americas represent outliers: countries with unusually low life expectancy relative to the rest of the distribution. So there's a lot that this plot tells us about differences in life expectancy across continents. We can see that the median life expectancy of Europe is one of the highest, and that the two countries in Oceana (Australia and New Zealand) both have very high values. We can also see that the distribution for Africa is unusually low, with about half of its countries having a life expectancy between 50 and 60 years.\n\n**4. Histogram vs box plot**\n\nA boxplot helps give more context to the shape of the earlier histogram, where there were two bumps: one for countries between 65 and 80 representing most of Europe, Asia, and the Americas, and another, lower distribution. You'll use boxplots to examine other differences in distribution between continents in the final exercises. \n\n## Comparing GDP per capita across continents\n\nA boxplot is useful for comparing a distribution of values across several groups. In this exercise, you'll examine the distribution of GDP per capita by continent. Since GDP per capita varies across several orders of magnitude, you'll need to put the y-axis on a log scale.\n\n**Steps**\n\n1. Use the `gapminder_1952` dataset (code is provided) to create a boxplot comparing GDP per capita (`gdpPercap`) among continents. Put the y-axis on a log scale with `scale_y_log10()`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Create a boxplot comparing gdpPercap among continents\nggplot(gapminder_1952, aes(x = continent, y = gdpPercap)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  scale_y_log10()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](03_programming_tidyverse_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-41-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nLooks good! What continents had countries with the highest GDP per capita?\n\n## Adding a title to your graph\n\nThere are many other options for customizing a `ggplot2` graph, which you can learn about in other DataCamp courses. You can also learn about them from online resources, which is an important skill to develop.\n\nAs the final exercise in this course, you'll practice looking up `ggplot2` instructions by completing a task we haven't shown you how to do.\n\n**Steps**\n\n1. Add a title to the graph: **Comparing GDP per capita across continents**. Use a search engine, such as Google or Bing, to learn how to do so.\n2.
