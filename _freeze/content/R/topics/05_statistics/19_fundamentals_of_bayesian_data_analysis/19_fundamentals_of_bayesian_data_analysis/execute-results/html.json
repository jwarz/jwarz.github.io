It provides a uniform framework to build problem specific models that can be used for both statistical inference and for prediction. This course will introduce you to Bayesian data analysis: What it is, how it works, and why it is a useful tool to have in your data science toolbox.\n\n# What is Bayesian Data Analysis?\n\n## Bayesian Inference in a Nutshell\n\nA method for figuring out unobservable quantities given known facts that uses probability to describe the uncertainty over what the values of the unknown quantities could be. Bayesian inferece == Probabilistic inference.\n\nThere are other inference methods for this, but what makes Bayesian inference Bayesian is that it uses probability to describe the uncertainty over what the values of the unknown quantities could be. \n\nThe role of probability distributions in Bauesian data analysis is to represent uncertainty, and the role of Bayesian inference is to update probability distributions to reflect what has been learned from data.\n\nBayesian Data Analysis:\n\n* The use of bayesian inference to learn from data (the known facts) inference about parameters.\n* Can be used for hypothesis testing, linear regressin, etc.\n* It’s real power: Is flexible and allows you to construct problem-specific models\n\n<hr>\n\nBayesian inference is a method for figuring out unknown or unobservable quantities given known facts. \n\nWhen analyzing data, we are also interested in learning about unknown quantities. For example, say that we are interested in how daily ice cream sales relate to the temperature, and we decide to use linear regression to investigate this.\n\n<center>\n  <img src=\"https://assets.datacamp.com/production/course_5334/datasets/ice_cream_sales.png\" alt>\n</center>\n\n> *Question*\n> ---\n> Which of the following quantities could be considered unknown in this case?<br>\n> <br>\n> ⬜ The slope of the underlying regression line.<br>\n> ⬜ How much ice cream sales vary on days with a similar temperature.<br>\n> ⬜ How many ice creams we will sell tomorrow given a forecast of 80°F / 27°C .<br>\n> ✅ All of the above.<br>\n\nRight, there are a lot of unknown things about which we want to learn. Bayesian data analysis can help with that!\n\nBayesian data analysis is named after Thomas Bayes who in the middle of the 18th century wrote the first article describing what we today would call Bayesian inference. But the term Bayesian inference doesn’t really give you any clues to what it is, and a better term would be probabilistic inference because that’s what you do when you do Bayesian data analysis. \n\nIt’s really just about using the full power of probability theory to draw conclusions and learn from your data. Confusingly the term probability can be defined in different ways. All definitions agree on the basic rules of probability and that it’s a number between 0 to 1, but they don’t agree on what probabilities stand for. The definition we are going to use here is that a probability is a statement about the certainty or uncertainty of different outcomes, where a probability of 1 means complete certainty that something is the case or is going to happen and 0 mean complete certainty that this something is not the case or that it’s not going to happen. This definition is very similar to the common sense use of probability. Like, you might say “I’m 99 % sure it’s gonna rain tomorrow”, which means you’re very certain, or you might say “It’s a 50-50 chance it’s going to rain” which means you’re very uncertain, it could go either way. Probability does not only have to be about yes/no-type of events, but it can also be used to describe uncertainty over continuous quantities. \n\nFor example, here is a graph showing the probability over how many inches it will rain next week. Each bar shows the probability for the corresponding outcome, and together the probabilities sum to one. \n\n![](readme_files/figure-gfm/prob_dist.png)\n\nThis graph here is also an example of a probability distribution, which just is an allocation of probability over many mutually exclusive outcomes. So, the role of probability distributions in Bayesian data analysis is to represent uncertainty, and the role of Bayesian inference is to update these probability distributions to reflect what has been learned from data. \n\n## Simple Bayesian model\n\nAll this sounds a bit abstract, let’s try running a simple Bayesian model and actually see how it looks. Let’s look at a Bayesian model for an underlying proportion of success. \n\nWhat is “success” here? Well, it could be curing a patient, getting a click on an ad, getting tails when flipping a coin, etc. It depends on what data you have. And what we’re often interested in is what the underlying proportion of success is. Like, what proportion of patients would be cured by this drug, say. \n\nI’ve implemented a Bayesian model in R that estimates this and given it the name `prop_model.` `prop_model` takes data as its first argument and assumes that: the data is a vector of successes and failures represented by 1s and 0s, that there is an unknown underlying proportion of success and whether a data point is a success or not is only affected by this proportion, and prior to seeing any data any underlying proportion of success is equally likely. The result of `prop_model` is a probability distribution that represents what the model knows about the underlying proportion of success after having observed the data.\n\nThe output of prop_model is a plot showing what the model learns about the underlying proportion of success from each data point in the order you entered them. At n=0 there is no data, and all the model knows is that it’s equally probable that the proportion of success is anything from 0% to 100%. At n=4 all data has been added, and the model knows a little bit more.\n\nWe will build toward implementing `prop_model()` during the following content.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\n#> ── Attaching packages ─────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse 1.3.2 ──\n#> ✔ tibble  3.1.8      ✔ dplyr   1.0.10\n#> ✔ tidyr   1.2.1      ✔ stringr 1.4.1 \n#> ✔ readr   2.1.3      ✔ forcats 0.5.2 \n#> ✔ purrr   0.3.5      \n#> ── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n#> ✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n#> ✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(ggridges)\n\n# The prop_model function\n\n# This function takes a number of successes and failuers coded as a TRUE/FALSE\n# or 0/1 vector.

The blue square is a uniform probability distribution saying that any proportion of success has equal probability. It’s labeled “Prior” because one assumption of the model was that prior to seeing any data any underlying proportion of success was equally likely. Now, let’s add a datapoint, let’s say this is from an experiment on whether patients got cured by a new drug.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata <- c(0)\nprop_model(data)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](19_fundamentals_of_bayesian_data_analysis_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nUnfortunately, the first patient didn’t get cured, marked red here for failure.

That was a quick little example of a simple Bayesian model. *`prop_model` isn’t part of any R package.*\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata <- c(0,1,0,0,0,1)\nprop_model(data)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](19_fundamentals_of_bayesian_data_analysis_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png){fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nLet's try out prop_model in a couple of exercises.\n\n### prop_model 2: Coin flips\n\nThe function `prop_model` implements a Bayesian model that assumes that:\n\n* The `data` is a vector of successes and failures represented by `1`s and `0`s.\n* There is an unknown underlying proportion of success.\n* Prior to being updated with data any underlying proportion of success is equally likely.\n\nAssume you just flipped a coin four times and the result was *heads*, *tails*, *tails*, *heads*.

The model knows it's not close to 0% or close to 100%, but believes it could be anything in between.\n\n### prop_model 3: Zombie drugs \n\nIf we really were interested in the underlying proportion of heads of this coin then `prop_model` isn't particularly useful. Since it assumes that any underlying proportion of success is equally likely prior to seeing any data it will take a lot of coin flipping to convince `prop_model` that the coin is fair. This model is more appropriate in a situation where we have little background knowledge about the underlying proportion of success.\n\nLet's say the zombie apocalypse is upon us and we have come up with a new experimental drug to cure zombieism. We have no clue how effective it's going to be, but when we gave it to 13 zombies two of them turned human again. \n\n**Steps**\n\n1. Change the `data` argument to `prop_model` to estimate the underlying proportion of success of curing a zombie.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Update the data and rerun prop_model\ndata = c(1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0,\n         0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)\nprop_model(data)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](19_fundamentals_of_bayesian_data_analysis_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png){fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n> *Question*\n> ---\n> The model implemented in prop_model makes more sense here as we had no clue how good the drug would be. The final probability distribution (at `n=13`) represents what the model now knows about the underlying proportion of cured zombies. What proportion of zombies would we expect to turn human if we administered this new drug to the whole zombie population?<br>\n> <br>\n> ⬜ Between 0% to 100%.<br>\n> ⬜ Between 25% to 75%.<br>\n> ✅ Between 5% to 40%.<br>\n> ⬜ Between 20% to 25%.<br>\n\nIt seems like it's not a perfect drug, but between 5% to 40% cured zombies is better than nothing!\n\n**Samples and posterior summaries**\n\nWe just did some Bayesian data analysis! We took a Bayesian model, gave it some data, and got out the probability distribution over the underlying proportion of success for a zombie drug. In Bayesian jargon, we took a \"prior probability distribution\", \"updated it\" with data, and the result was a \"posterior probability distribution\". These two words, prior and posterior, are used so much in Bayesian data analysis that they are worth pointing out. A prior probability distribution is a distribution over some unknown quantity that you have before, prior to, updating it with some data. In the plot above it would be the blue distribution. The posterior probability distribution is what this distribution turned into after, posterior to, we updated it with data. Here it would be the last distribution at n=13. \n\n* **prior** - a probability distribution that represents what the model knows before seeing the data\n* **posterior** - a probability distribution that represents what the model knows after having seen the data.\n\nOften people drop the “probability distribution”-part and just call these priors and posteriors. So, a prior is a probability distribution that represents what the model knows before seeing the data. A posterior is a probability distribution that represents what the model knows after having seen the data. When fitting a Bayesian model, the end result is always a posterior over some quantity or parameter of interest. The posterior represents how uncertain the model is of the underlying value, and in the zombie example, the posterior was displayed as a density plot showing the location of the probability. This could be a good way of communicating the result, but we might also want to summarize it further, for example, we might want to calculate a “best guess” for what the proportion of cured zombies would be. This calculation is easier to do if the posterior is represented as a vector of samples rather than as a plot. \n\n**The probability distribution over the number of 6's when rolling 5 dice**\n\nWhat do I mean by this? Well, take, for example, the probability distribution over the number of sixes you would get when rolling 5 dice. You can represent that distribution as a plot, \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npd <- function(n){\n  df <- data.frame(\n    prob = dbinom(0:n, n, 1/6),\n    m = 0:n\n  )\n  ggplot(df, aes(m, prob)) +\n    geom_col(fill = \"steelblue\") \n}\npd(5)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](19_fundamentals_of_bayesian_data_analysis_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png){fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# base r\n# plot(0:n, dbinom(0:n, n, 1/6), \n#     type = \"h\", lwd = 20, col=\"lightblue\", \n#     lend = 3,   ann = FALSE,\n#     las  = 1,   bty = 'n')\n```\n:::\n\n\nor as a mathematical function, if that’s your thing:\n\np(x) = (5 x)(1/6)^x(1-(1/6))^(5-x)\n\n\\binom{5}{x}(\\frac{1}{6})^x(1-(\\frac{1}{6}))^{5-x}\n\nBut you can also represent it as a long vector of samples where a value occurs proportionally often to how probable it is. Having such a vector makes it easy to calculate new measures from the probability distribution. Say we want to know the average number of sixes we would expect to roll. This is hard to read from the plot, but easy to calculate using the vector of samples as we can directly use the mean function in R. \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n### rbinom(number of experiments, number of observations per experiment, probability of success)\nnumber_of_sixes <- rbinom(10000, 5, 1/6)\nhead(number_of_sixes)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n#> [1] 1 1 0 1 2 0\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n### rbinom(number of experiments, number of observations per experiment, probability of success)\nnumber_of_sixes_mean <- number_of_sixes |> mean()\nnumber_of_sixes_mean\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n#> [1] 0.8253\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nTurns out the average number of sixes is 0.822 (Inline code execution does not work at the moment. Value might vary.). The easiest way of generating samples is by drawing a random sample from the probability distribution, and if this sample is large enough, each value will occur roughly proportionally often to how probable it is.\n\nNow, it’s actually the case that the `prop_model` function also returns a large random sample from the posterior distribution.\n\nSo, let's finish off the zombie drug analysis we started earlier by calculating a couple of relevant summaries using the sample returned by prop_model. Here again is the `prop_model` function which has been given the data from our zombie experiment where two out of 13 zombies got cured. In addition to producing a plot, `prop_model` also returns a large random sample from the posterior over the underlying proportion of success.\n\n**Steps**\n\n1. Assign the return value of `prop_model` to a variable called `posterior` and take a look at the first number of samples.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata = c(1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0,\n         0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)\n\n# Extract and explore the posterior\nposterior <- prop_model(data)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](19_fundamentals_of_bayesian_data_analysis_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png){fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhead(posterior)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n#> [1] 0.45273968 0.08982111 0.12240656 0.15827327 0.03746298 0.29530722\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nLooking at these first few samples confirms what is already shown in the plot: That the underlying proportion of cured zombies is likely somewhere between 5% and 50%. But these were just the first six samples in `posterior` which currently contain 10,000 samples (the default of `prop_model`). \n\n2. Take a look at the distribution of *all* the samples in `posterior` by plotting it as a histogram.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Plot the histogram of the posterior\nhist(posterior, breaks = 30, xlim = c(0, 1), col = \"palegreen4\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](19_fundamentals_of_bayesian_data_analysis_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png){fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nCompare this histogram to the plot produced directly by `prop_model`. You should notice that the histogram and the posterior distribution (at n=13) describe the same distribution. OK, so you got a vector of samples from prop_model and confirmed that they are a good representation of the posterior distribution. \n\n### Summarizing the zombie drug experiment\n\nThe point of working with samples from a probability distribution is that it makes it *easy* to calculate new measures of interest. The following steps are about doing just this!\n\nA *point estimate* is a single number used to summarize what's known about a parameter of interest. It can be seen as a \"best guess\" of the value of the parameter. A commonly used point estimate is the **median** of the posterior. It's the midpoint of the distribution, and it's equally probable for the parameter value to be larger than the median as it is to be smaller than it. \n\n**Steps**\n\n1. Calculate the median of `posterior`.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Calculate the median\nmedian(posterior)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n#> [1] 0.1858607\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nSo, a best guess is that the drug would cure around 18% of all zombies. Another common summary is to report an interval that includes the parameter of interest with a certain probability. This is called a *credible interval* (CI). With a posterior represented as a vector of samples you can calculate a CI using the `quantile()` function. \n\n`quantile()` takes the vector of samples as its first argument and the second argument is a vector defining how much probability should be left below and above the CI. For example, the vector `c(0.05, 0.95)` would yield a 90% CI and `c(0.25, 0.75)` would yield a 50% CI.\n\n2. Calculate a 90% credible interval of posterior.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Calculate the credible interval\nquantile(posterior, c(0.05, 0.95))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n#>         5%        95% \n#> 0.06178219 0.38641151\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAccording to the credible interval, there is a 90% probability that the proportion of zombies the drug would cure is between 6% and 38%. (Here we have to be careful to remember that the percentage of cured zombies and the percentage of probability are two different things.)\n\nNow, there is a rival zombie laboratory that is also working on a drug. They claim that they are certain that their drug cures 7% of the zombies it's administered to. Can we calculate how probable it is that our drug is better? Yes, we can! But it's a two stage process.\n\n3. First, use `sum` to count how many samples in posterior that are larger than 7%. Do this by giving `posterior > 0.07` as the argument to sum.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Calculate the sum\nsum(posterior > 0.07)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n#> [1] 9322\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nTo turn this count into a probability we now need to *normalize* it, that is, divide it by the total number of samples in `posterior`.\n\n4. Divide the result of `sum` by the number of samples in `posterior`.

You’ve done some Bayesian data analysis and you’ve summarized the result. If we would take this result, write it up, and send it to the International Journal on Zombieology, it could go something like this:\n\nGiven the data of two cured and 11 relapsed zombies, and using the Bayesian model described before, there is a 90% probability that our drug cures between 6% and 39% of treated zombies. Further, there is 93% probability that our drug cures zombies at a higher rate than current state of the art drugs. \n\nNow, this was a very simple Bayesian model, there was just one parameter to estimate, the underlying proportion of success. In the next section, we’re going to take a detailed look at how Bayesian inference actually works.\n\n# 2. How does Bayesian inference work?\n\nIn this chapter we will take a detailed look at the foundations of Bayesian inference.\n\n**The parts needed for Bayesian inference**\n\nIn the last section, we ran a small but complete Bayesian data analysis from start to finish. Now we are going to do it all over again. But this time we’ll go slowly, and the goal is for you to understand how Bayesian inference actually works. First, let’s look at all the parts that are needed to do Bayesian inference. \n\nSo Bayesian inference was a method for learning about unknown quantities from data, for example model parameters or what future data could look like. It requires three things to work:\n\n1. Data\n2. Generative model\n3. Priors (what the model knows before seeing the data)\n\n## Generative model\n\nWhat is a generative model? Well, it’s a very general concept, it’s any kind of computer program, mathematical expression, or set of rules that you can feed fixed parameter values and that you can use to generate simulated data. As an example, let’s whip up a generative model for the zombie drug experiment, and let’s define it as a small program in R. There are many ways we could do this, but let’s go with something simple. First, as before, let’s assume that there is an underlying proportion of zombies that will be cured by the drug and that the drug is given to a number of zombies. These are the parameters of the model, and we could set them to anything, but for now, let’s just set `prop_success` to 0.15 and `n_zombies` to 13. \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n # Parameters\nprop_success <- 0.15\nn_zombies    <- 13\n```\n:::\n\n\nNow we’re going to simulate data, so we’ll start by creating an empty data vector, and for each zombie we’re going to simulate a `1` if cured and a `0` if not cured. But how do we do this? The simple assumption I’m going to make is that whether a zombie gets cured only depends on the underlying proportion of success, and nothing else. Here that means we want to simulate a `1`, a success, 15% of the time. We can do that by sampling a single number from a uniform probability distribution between 0 and 1, and if that is less than 0.15 we’ll call it a success.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Simulating data\ndata <- c()\nfor(zombie in 1:n_zombies) {\n  data[zombie] <- runif(1, min = 0, max = 1) < prop_success\n}\ndata <- as.numeric(data)\ndata\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n#>  [1] 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis gives us almost what we want, except that the simulated data is a vector of TRUEs and FALSEs, so the last step is to turn this into numbers instead. Alright, we have a generative model for curing zombies; every time we run it, it generates some simulated data for us.\n\nThis is actually the generative model behind the Bayesian `prop_model` function we used to analyze the zombie data in the last chapter, but at this point, it’s still not clear how this generative model relates to Bayesian inference. We’ll come around to that eventually, but for now, take this generative model for a spin in a couple of exercises.\n\n**Steps**\n\n1. Generate a simulated dataset. Assume the underlying proportion of success of curing a zombie is 42% and that you administer the drug to 100 zombies.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# The generative zombie drug model\n\n# set parameters\nprop_success <- 0.42\nn_zombies <- 100\n\n# Simulating data\ndata <- c()\nfor(zombie in 1:n_zombies) {\n  data[zombie] <- runif(1, min = 0, max = 1) < prop_success\n}\ndata <- as.numeric(data)\ndata\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n#>   [1] 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0\n#>  [38] 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n#>  [75] 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nInstead of representing cured zombies as a vector of `1`s and `0`s it could be represented as a *count* of the number of cured out of the total number of treated. \n\n2. Change the code to count how many zombies in `data` were cured. Use the `sum` function for this and assign this count to `data` instead of the vector of `1`s and `0`s.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# The generative zombie drug model\n\n# Parameters\nprop_success <- 0.42\nn_zombies <- 100\n\n# Simulating data\ndata <- c()\nfor(zombie in 1:n_zombies) {\n  data[zombie] <- runif(1, min = 0, max = 1) < prop_success\n}\n\n# Count cured\ndata <- sum( as.numeric(data) )\ndata\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n#> [1] 35\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nPerfect! Some zombies got cured in this simulation, but far from all.\n\n## Generative model: Binomial distribution \n\nIt turns out that the generative model you ran last exercise already has a name. It's called the **binomial process** or the **binomial distribution**. In R you can use the `rbinom` function to simulate data from a binomial distribution. The `rbinom` function takes three arguments:\n\n* `n` The number of times you want to run the generative model\n* `size` The number of trials. (For example, the number of zombies you're giving the drug.)\n* `prob` The underlying proportion of success as a number between `0.0` and `1.0`.\n\n**Steps**\n\n1. Replicate the result from the last step using the `rbinom` function: Simulate one count of the number of cured zombies out of a 100 treated, where the underlying proportion of success is 42%.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Try out rbinom\nrbinom(n = 1, size = 100, prob = 0.42)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n#> [1] 33\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nA nice thing with `rbinom` is that it makes it easy to rerun the generative model many times. \n\n2.

That's a lot of simulated zombies right there.\n\n## Using a generative model\n\nEarlier we implemented a generative model from scratch, but in the last exercise you realized that that was unnecessary work as this generative model was the same as the binomial distribution function. And it’s actually the case that all probability distributions, like the normal distribution or the Poisson distribution, can be seen as small generative models, and there are many more that are implemented in R. But for now, we’ll stick with the binomial distribution. \n\nSo, now we have a generative model, where we can plug in fixed parameter values and it will generate simulated data for us. This could be useful if we know exactly what parameter values we want, and we want to predict what future unknown data might be. Say we are completely sure that our drug cures 7% of all zombies, but we want to know how many we’ll likely cure when we give the drug to the 100 zombies we have in our zombie pit.\n\nWe could then plug in 100 and 0.07 as parameters to rbinom and then run this generative model a large number of times by setting n to, say, 100000. \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncured_zombies <- rbinom(n = 100000, size = 100, prob = 0.07)\nhead(cured_zombies)\nhist(cured_zombies, col = \"palegreen4\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe result is a long vector of samples, which now represents the probability distribution over how many zombies we will cure. If we plot it as a histogram using the hist function we see that we’ll probably cure between 3 to 12 of the 100 zombies in our pit. Of course, this only makes sense if we are very certain that our drug cures 7% of all zombies.\n\nSo we can go from known parameters to unknown data, the problem is that in data analysis we are often in the complete opposite situation. We know what the data is, it’s not uncertain, and we want to work our way backward and figure out what are likely the parameter values that generated this data. This is what we are going to use Bayesian inference for. But we can’t do that yet, because, if you remember, we don’t have all the parts we need.\n\nWe have defined a generative model, so we can tick that off, but we still need priors and data. \n\n## Bayesian inference (Ads)\n\nGoing forward we are leaving the zombies behind and will continue our journey towards understanding Bayesian inference with this new, fresh business example. \n\nAssume you are running a website and to get more visitors you are going to pay for an ad to be shown on a popular social media site. You are thinking about paying for the ad to be shown a 100 times but you’re uncertain whether it’s worth it, how many more site visits is it really going to generate? According to the social media site, their ads get clicked on 10% of the time. Let’s start by taking this number at face value and produce a probability distribution over how many visitors you’ll get. The binomial model should work well here too, but instead of how many zombies will get cured, we now want to know how many ads will get clicked.\n\nTo get more visitors to your website you are considering paying for an ad to be shown 100 times on a popular social media site. According to the social media site, their ads get clicked on 10% of the time.\n\nAssume that 10% is a reasonable number, and assume that the binomial distribution is a reasonable generative model for how people click on ads.\n\n**Steps**\n\n1. Fill in the missing parameters and use the `rbinom` function to generate a sample that represents the probability distribution over what the number of visitors to your site is going to be. \n2. Visualize this distribution using `hist`.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Fill in the parameters\nn_samples   <- 100000\nn_ads_shown <- 100\nproportion_clicks <- 0.1\nn_visitors <- rbinom(n_samples, size = n_ads_shown, \n                     prob = proportion_clicks)\n# Visualize n_visitors\nhist(n_visitors)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](19_fundamentals_of_bayesian_data_analysis_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-26-1.png){fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n> *Question*\n> ---\n> You would like the ad campaign to result in at least 5 visitors to your site. Eyeballing the plot you just produced, what is the probability you will get 5 or more visitors because of the ad?<br>\n> <br>\n> ⬜ 10%<br>\n> ⬜ 20%<br>\n> ⬜ 70%<br>\n> ✅ 90%<br>\n\n## Prior probability distribution\n\nIt’s time to add one more part that we will need to do Bayesian inference: a prior probability distribution, which represents how uncertain the model is about the parameters before seeing any data. And ideally, this uncertainty should reflect our uncertainty.\n\nNow, we know we’re going to run 100 ads, so that’s not uncertain, but that an ad gets clicked on 10% of the time, as the social media site claims, that is a curiously precise number. Especially when taking into account that not all ads are the same. Surely some ads perform better than others, and we don’t know how good our ad is. You are still interested in how many site visits the ad is going to generate, but since we really are uncertain about the underlying proportion of clicks we now want to include some of that uncertainty into the binomial model. There are many different probability distributions we could use to represent that uncertainty. For now, we’re going to assume that it’s equally likely that the underlying proportion of clicks could be as low as 0%, like, it’s a horrible ad, and nobody will ever click it, or as high as 20%, twice as good as the 10% claimed by the social media site. \n\nThese assumptions translate into a uniform distribution from 0 to 0.2 over the underlying proportion of clicks. Now we need to change the R code that implements the model. Instead of assigning `proportion_clicks` a single value we are now going to assign it a large number of random samples from a *uniform probability distribution*. In R you can do that using the `runif` function, standing for random uniform. \n\nFor example, this would sample just 6 values from 0 to 1.0 and put them into `proportion_clicks`. \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nproportion_clicks <- runif(n = 6, min = 0.0, max = 1.0)\nproportion_clicks\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n#> [1] 0.8616029 0.2746156 0.7991563 0.1178076 0.4448118 0.7093398\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nA neat thing is that because most random number functions are vectorized it’s very easy to chain probability distributions together in R. For example if we now use `proportion_clicks` as the argument to rbinom, then rbinom will automatically loop over the values in `proportion_clicks`. \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nn_clicks <- rbinom(n = 6, size = 100, proportion_clicks)\nn_clicks\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n#> [1] 86 33 86 10 39 66\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIf we look at the resulting values in `n_clicks`, we can see this. The first value in `proportion_clicks` is used to sample the first value in `n_clicks.` As it’s just an 0.05 proportion of success the number of successes in `n_clicks` becomes only 7 out of a 100. The second value in `proportion_clicks` is used to sample the second in  `n_clicks`, and so on. This means that the variability from `runif()` gets combined with the variability of `rbinom()`. The result is that the samples in `n_clicks` now also incorporates the uncertainty in `proportion_clicks`. \n\n## Adding a prior to the model\n\nYou're not so sure that your ad will get clicked on exactly 10% of the time. Instead of assigning `proportion_clicks` a single value you are now going to assign it a large number of values drawn from a probability distribution.\n\nFor now, we are going to assume that it's equally likely that `proportion_clicks` could be as low as 0% or as high as 20%. These assumptions translate into a uniform distribution.\n\n**Steps**\n\n1. Replace the single value that is assigned to `proportion_clicks` with `n_samples` samples produced by `runif` as above.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nn_samples   <- 100000\nn_ads_shown <- 100\n\n# Update proportion_clicks\nproportion_clicks <- runif(n_samples, min = 0.0, max = 0.2)\n\nn_visitors <- rbinom(n = n_samples, size = n_ads_shown, prob = proportion_clicks)\n```\n:::\n\n\nBecause the `rbinom` function is *vectorized* the first value of `proportion_clicks` is used to sample the first value in `n_visitors`, the second value in `proportion_clicks` is used for the second in `n_visitors`, and so on. The result is that the samples in `n_visitors` now also incorporate the uncertainty in what the underlying proportion of clicks could be.\n\n2. First, visualize the uncertainty in `proportion_clicks` using the `hist` function.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nn_samples <- 100000\nn_ads_shown <- 100\nproportion_clicks <- runif(n_samples, min = 0.0, max = 0.2)\nn_visitors <- rbinom(n = n_samples, size = n_ads_shown, prob = proportion_clicks)\n\n# Visualize proportion clicks\nhist(proportion_clicks)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](19_fundamentals_of_bayesian_data_analysis_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-30-1.png){fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nYou shouldn't be surprised to see that the uncertainty over `proportion_clicks` is just as you specified it to be: Uniform between 0.0 and 0.2 (except for some small variations in the height of the bars because we took a random sample using `runif`).\n\n3. Now, visualize the uncertainty in `n_visitors` again using the `hist` function.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Visualize n_visitors\nhist(n_visitors)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](19_fundamentals_of_bayesian_data_analysis_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-31-1.png){fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis looks very different from the histogram of `n_visitors` we got in the last exercise when `proportion_clicks` was exactly 0.1. With the added uncertainty in `proportion_clicks` the uncertainty over the number of visitors we 'll get also increased.\n\n> *Question*\n> ---\n> Eyeballing the plot you just produced, what is the probability you will get 5 or more visitors because of the ad?<br>\n> <br>\n> ⬜ 10%<br>\n> ⬜ 20%<br>\n> ✅ 70%<br>\n> ⬜ 90%<br>\n\n## Bayesian models and conditioning\n\nNow we have a generative model and priors, and together these form a Bayesian model.\n\nSo if some statistician is talking about that she’s developed a Bayesian model of something, that just means she has specified a generative model for the data plus priors over what is uncertain in the model. The only thing we need now to do Bayesian inference is some data. You just decided to run your ad campaign. And it went better than expected!When the ad was shown a 100 times, 13 people clicked and visited your site. So now we have data, and we are ready to do some Bayesian inference, we are ready to use this data to learn about how likely people are to click on your ad. \n\nHow could we do that? Let’s take a look at the model we have so far and see if we can figure that out. The prior over `proportion_clicks` and the generative model for `n_visitors` together define a prior probability distribution over both parameters and future, unknown data. Let's put these together in a data frame and call it just `prior.`\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nn_samples   <- 100000\nn_ads_shown <- 100\nproportion_clicks <- runif(n_samples, min = 0.0, max = 0.2)\nn_visitors <- rbinom(n = n_samples, size = n_ads_shown,\n                     prob = proportion_clicks)\nprior <- data.frame(proportion_clicks, n_visitors)\n```\n:::\n\n\nNow the data frame `prior` represents the joint probability distribution of `proportion_clicks` and `n_visitors` together. \n\n\nWe could have a look at the first couple of samples in this data frame.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhead(prior)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<div data-pagedtable=\"false\">\n  <script data-pagedtable-source type=\"application/json\">\n{\"columns\":[{\"label\":[\"\"],\"name\":[\"_rn_\"],\"type\":[\"\"],\"align\":[\"left\"]},{\"label\":[\"proportion_clicks\"],\"name\":[1],\"type\":[\"dbl\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]},{\"label\":[\"n_visitors\"],\"name\":[2],\"type\":[\"int\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]}],\"data\":[{\"1\":\"0.14962888\",\"2\":\"12\",\"_rn_\":\"1\"},{\"1\":\"0.02940844\",\"2\":\"1\",\"_rn_\":\"2\"},{\"1\":\"0.05176008\",\"2\":\"5\",\"_rn_\":\"3\"},{\"1\":\"0.18968375\",\"2\":\"12\",\"_rn_\":\"4\"},{\"1\":\"0.16216906\",\"2\":\"20\",\"_rn_\":\"5\"},{\"1\":\"0.07354111\",\"2\":\"4\",\"_rn_\":\"6\"}],\"options\":{\"columns\":{\"min\":{},\"max\":[10]},\"rows\":{\"min\":[10],\"max\":[10]},\"pages\":{}}}\n  </script>\n</div>\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\nBut it’s easier to see what going on if we plot this data frame as a scatter plot. \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nprior_plot <- ggplot( prior, aes( x = n_visitors, y = proportion_clicks ) ) +\n  geom_point( alpha = 1/10 , color = \"deepskyblue4\") +\n    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +\n  #geom_jitter(alpha = 1/10 ) +\n  theme_classic()\n  \n# theme(legend.position = 'none' ,\n#       panel.grid.major = element_blank(), \n#       panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n#       panel.background = element_blank(), \n#       axis.line = element_line(colour = \"black\"))\n\n# prior_plot <- plot(prior$n_visitors, prior$proportion_clicks, col= alpha(\"deepskyblue4\", 0.4))\n\nlibrary(ggExtra)\nprior_plot <- ggMarginal( prior_plot, type = 'histogram',\n                          fill = \"deepskyblue4\",\n                          xparams = list(  bins=20 ),\n                          yparams = list(  bins=20))\nprior_plot\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](19_fundamentals_of_bayesian_data_analysis_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-34-1.png){fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\nOn the x-axis we have the number of visitors, and on the y-axis we have the underlying proportion of clicks.

We clearly see a pattern in the plot, the higher the underlying proportion of clicks, the more visitors we’ll probably get. But we also see that the more visitors we get, the higher the underlying proportion of clicks probably is. \n\nIf we knew that `proportion_clicks` was exactly 10%, we could condition on this, that is, remove all samples that don’t fulfill the condition of proportion_clicks being 10%. \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(ggExtra)\nplot_prior <- function(x, filter_var) {\n  \n  var_quo = quo_name(enquo(filter_var))\n  \n  # Add flag for ~10% values\n  prior10_df <- prior %>%\n    mutate( p10 = !!filter_var == x ) \n  \n  prior_plot <- ggplot( prior10_df |> filter(p10), aes( x = n_visitors, y = proportion_clicks ) ) +\n    \n    geom_point( alpha = 0.5, color = \"deepskyblue4\", shape = 1, stroke = 0.8) +\n    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +\n    \n    # Use annotae, so that the data will not be used in ggMarginal\n    annotate(geom = \"point\", x = prior10_df |> filter(!p10) |> pull(n_visitors), y = prior10_df |> filter(!p10) |> pull(proportion_clicks), \n             color = \"darkgrey\", alpha = 1/10, shape = 1, stroke = 1) +\n    \n    # Add point layer again to bring it to top\n    geom_point( alpha = 0.5, color = \"deepskyblue4\", shape = 1, stroke = 1) + \n    \n    {if(var_quo == \"n_visitors\")geom_vline(xintercept = x, linetype=\"dashed\", color = \"black\", size = 1) else \n                                geom_hline(yintercept = x, linetype=\"dashed\", color = \"black\", size = 1)}+\n    \n    # geom_hline(yintercept=x, linetype=\"dashed\", color = \"black\", size = 1) +\n    theme_classic()\n    \n  prior_plot <- ggMarginal( prior_plot, type = 'histogram', \n                            fill = \"deepskyblue4\",\n                            xparams = list(  bins=20 ),\n                            yparams = list(  bins=20))\n  prior_plot\n}\n\n\n# Set proportion_clicks to 10 %\nplot_prior(x = 0.1, round(proportion_clicks,2))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\n#> Warning: Using `size` aesthetic for lines was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.\n#> ℹ Please use `linewidth` instead.\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](19_fundamentals_of_bayesian_data_analysis_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-35-1.png){fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis would also reduce the uncertainty in how many visitors we would get.

You started by specifying a generative model from scratch in R but then realized this was the same as the Binomial model. \n2. You specified a prior probability distribution over the underlying proportion of clicks representing prior information; it’s likely between 0% and 20%, but also that it is uncertain, it could be anything from 0% to 20%. \n3. Together the generative model and this prior resulted in a joint probability distribution over both the underlying proportion of clicks and how many visitors you would get. \n4. You collected some data and used this to condition the joint distribution, in other words, you used Bayesian inference. This allowed the model to learn about the underlying proportion of clicks and resulted in an updated posterior probability distribution. \n5. And, finally, as a bonus, we used this posterior as the prior for the next ad campaign and predicted how many visitors we would get if reran it. \n\nI hope you can see that if you collected even more data, you could continue repeating these steps, to learn more and more about the underlying proportion of clicks.This is exactly how `prop_model` from the first chapter worked; it used the same Bayesian model with the only difference that the prior was uniform from 0 to 100% and that the model was updated with one success or failure at a time. \n\nTaking a step back, what have we done? We have specified\n\n* prior information,\n* a generative model,\n* and given some data we calculated the\n* updated probability of different parameter values. \n\nIn the examples so far we’ve used a Binomial model with a single parameter, but the cool thing here is that the general method of Bayesian inference works for any generative model, with any number of parameters. That is, you can have any number of parameters and unknown values, that you plug into any generative model that you can implement, and the data can be multivariate or can consist of completely different data sets, and the Bayesian machinery that we used in the simple case works in the same way.\n\nThis is why Bayesian methods are so broadly used, in everything from hypothesis testing to machine learning: As long as you can come up with a generative model for a data analytical problem, Bayesian inference can always be used to fit this model and learn from data. Well, in theory at least, because in practice you also need to use a computational method that’s efficient enough. And the method we used in this section is straightforward, easy to understand, but also scales very badly when you have more data or more complicated models. \n\nSo that’s actually the fourth thing you need to do Bayesian inference. \n\nIn this chapter, we looked at how Bayesian inference works. Next up we’ll look at some reasons for why you would want to use it to do Bayesian data analysis.\n\n# 3. Why use Bayesian Data Analysis?\n\nThis chapter will show you four reasons why Bayesian data analysis is a useful tool to have in your data science tool belt.\n\nSo why would you want to use Bayesian data analysis, rather than some other method? So far, it seems like I’ve given you reasons for why not to use it: It mostly requires a lot of work, and you need to set everything up from scratch. But the reason for all this work was so that you would understand what’s going on under the hood. Once you know that, there are many good pre-packaged tools for Bayesian data analysis that just lets you get on with your work.\n\n**1. Bayes is flexible**\n\nSo the main reason to use Bayes is that it is a very flexible method to model, analyze and learn from data. \n\n1. Can include information sources in addition to the data\n\n    * Background Information\n    * Expert Opinion\n    * Common Knowledge\n    * ex: suppose you ask a vendor what the median and range of success has been for previous ad campaigns.\n    \nThe Bayesian model we used last, knows that the underlying proportion of clicks is equally likely to be anything between 0% and 20%. This is already a prior that contains some information: we’re basically telling the model that it is impossible that the proportion of clicks is any higher than 20% and if we really didn’t want to assume anything regarding the proportion of clicks we could make this into a more non-informative prior by saying it’s equally likely that it’s anything from 0% to a 100%. \n\nBut now we want to have a prior distribution that encodes the information that “Most ads get clicked on 5% of the time, but for some ads it is as low as 2% and for others as high as 8%.”There are many ways we could define such a distribution. You could even draw a distribution on paper, scan it in, and transfer it to R somehow. But a convenient way is to use a pre-defined probability distribution function that you can tweak so that it encodes prior information. In our case, a useful distribution could be the Beta distribution. It’s a distribution that is bounded between 0 and 1, which is useful when you want to define a distribution over a proportion, and depending on its two shape parameters alpha and beta it can take on many different shapes. In the next section, you will take a look at the Beta distribution and how you can use it to define a prior that is informed by the new info we got from the social media company.\n\n2. Can make many comparisons between groups or data sets\n\n    * Can test different experimental conditions\n    * Can easily find the probable difference between treatment groups\n    * ex: suppose you have two different treatment groups\n\n3. Can use the result of Bayesian Analysis to do Decision Analysis\n\n    *  **Decision Analysis:** take the result of a statistical analysis and post-process it to apply to a process of interest.\n    * the posterior distributions are not of principal interest, rather an outcome to meet a goal (e.g. highest return/clickthrough)\n    \n4. Can change the underlying statistical model\n\n    * if new data indicates the need for a change e.g. from a binomial model to include a new variable(s)\n    \n5. Bayes is optimal in the small world that is the model\n6. In Bayesian data analysis there is a separation between model and computation\n\n## Beta distribution as a prior\n\nThe Beta distribution is a useful probability distribution when you want model uncertainty over a parameter bounded between 0 and 1. Here you'll explore how the two parameters of the Beta distribution determine its shape.\n\nOne way to see how the shape parameters of the Beta distribution affect its shape is to generate a large number of random draws using the `rbeta(n, shape1, shape2)` function and visualize these as a histogram. \n\n**Steps**\n\n1. Generate 1,000,000 draws from a Beta(1, 1) distribution: A Beta distribution with both shape parameters set to 1. \n2. Visualize these draws using the `hist` function.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Explore using the rbeta function\nbeta_sample <- rbeta(n = 1000000, shape1 = 1, shape2 = 1)\n\n# Visualize the results\nhist(beta_sample)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](19_fundamentals_of_bayesian_data_analysis_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-45-1.png){fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nA Beta(1,1) distribution is the same as a uniform distribution between 0 and 1. It is useful as a so-called *non-informative* prior as it expresses than any value from 0 to 1 is equally likely. \n\n2. Set one of the shape parameters to a negative number. \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Explore using the rbeta function\nbeta_sample <- rbeta(n = 1000000, shape1 = -1, shape2 = 1)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\n#> Warning in rbeta(n = 1e+06, shape1 = -1, shape2 = 1): NAs produziert\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Explore the results\nhead(beta_sample)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n#> [1] NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n`NaN` stands for *not a number* and the reason you got a lot of `NaN`s is that the Beta distribution is only defined when its shape parameters are positive.\n\n3. Instead, set both shape parameters to a large number. Let's set both `shape1` and `shape2` to `100`. \n4. Visualize the result using `hist()`.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Explore using the rbeta function\nbeta_sample <- rbeta(n = 1000000, shape1 = 100, shape2 = 100)\n\n# Visualize the results\nhist(beta_sample)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](19_fundamentals_of_bayesian_data_analysis_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-47-1.png){fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nSo the larger the shape parameters are, the more concentrated the beta distribution becomes. When used as a prior, this Beta distribution encodes the information that the parameter is most likely close to 0.5 .\n\n5. See what happens if you set `shape2` to something smaller than `shape1`. Let's set `shape2 = 20` while keeping `shape1 = 100`.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Explore using the rbeta function\nbeta_sample <- rbeta(n = 1000000, shape1 = 100, shape2 = 20)\n\n# Visualize the results\nhist(beta_sample)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](19_fundamentals_of_bayesian_data_analysis_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-48-1.png){fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nSo the larger the `shape1` parameter is the closer the resulting distribution is to 1.0 and the larger the `shape2` the closer it is to 0. \n\n## Pick the prior that best captures the information\n\nThe new information you got from the social media company was: \n\n> Most ads get clicked on 5% of the time, but for some ads it is as low as 2% and for others as high as 8%.\n\nThere are many different probability distributions that one can argue captures this information. \n\n> *Question*\n> ---\n> Out of the four Beta distribution shown below, which captures this information the best?<br>\n> <br>\n> ⬜ A. rbeta(shape1 = 3, shape2 = 12)<br>\n> ⬜ B. rbeta(shape1 = 15, shape2 = 75)<br>\n> ✅ C. rbeta(shape1 = 5, shape2 = 95)<br>\n> ⬜ D. rbeta(shape1 = 30, shape2 = 10)<br>\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# 1.

And here is the new informed prior. \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata_tbl <- tibble(\n  \n  proportion_clicks = list(runif( n = n_samples, min = 0.0, max = 0.2),\n                           rbeta( n = n_samples, shape1 = 5, shape2 = 95)),\n  \n  n_visitors        = list(rbinom(n = n_samples, size = n_ads_shown, prob = proportion_clicks[[1]]),\n                           rbinom(n = n_samples, size = n_ads_shown, prob = proportion_clicks[[2]])),\n  \n  prior             = list(data.frame(proportion_clicks = proportion_clicks[[1]], n_visitors = n_visitors[[1]]),\n                           data.frame(proportion_clicks = proportion_clicks[[2]], n_visitors = n_visitors[[2]])),\n  \n  posterior         = list(prior[[1]][prior[[1]]$n_visitors == 13, ],\n                           prior[[2]][prior[[2]]$n_visitors == 13, ])\n  \n) |> \n  pivot_longer(cols = c(prior, posterior), names_to = \"distribution\", values_to = \"data\") |> \n  mutate(color = c(\"palegreen\", \"chartreuse4\", \"lightblue\", \"blue3\"),\n         title =c(\"Old prior\", \"Old posterior\", \"Informed prior\", \"Informed posterior\"))\n\n\n# 2.

But now we just have a little data, so the resulting posterior is a mix of the information from the prior and the information from the data. The data is enthusiastic: “Hey, the proportion of clicks is likely around 13%!” The prior is less so: “Mmmm, it’s likely around 5%”. The resulting posterior is informed by both the data and the prior and ends up somewhere in between. Now we have two different models of the same data, so which should we choose? There is no correct answer here, but if the informed prior is based on genuinely good information, then the resulting estimate should be better. In this case, it’s up to you if you believe the numbers you got from the social media company. Going forward we’re going to go back to the uniform distribution between 0% and 20% we used before, but now you know how easy it is to switch the prior, would you want to. \n\n## 2. Comparison between gruops or datasets\n\nNext up on reasons to use Bayesian data analysis is that it is easy to compare and contrast any outcomes from Bayesian models. A typical example of when you want to make comparisons is when you have two different experimental groups, like two different treatments or two different methods, and you want to compare these and see which seems the best. For example, say that the ads you’ve been running so far have been video ads, but you’ve been thinking that text ads could be more effective. To try this out you also paid for 100 text ads to be shown on the social media site, and that resulted in 6 clicks and visits to your site. But as the video ads resulted in 13 clicks it seems like they are more effective, but how sure should you be of this? We could run the same model on the data from the video ads and the text ads, and take a look at the corresponding posteriors over the underlying proportions of clicks. \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata_tbl <- tibble(\n  \n  proportion_clicks = list(runif( n = n_samples, min = 0.0, max = 0.2),\n                           runif( n = n_samples, min = 0.0, max = 0.2)),\n  \n  n_visitors        = list(rbinom(n = n_samples, size = n_ads_shown, prob = proportion_clicks[[1]]),\n                           rbinom(n = n_samples, size = n_ads_shown, prob = proportion_clicks[[2]])),\n  \n  prior             = list(data.frame(proportion_clicks = proportion_clicks[[1]], n_visitors = n_visitors[[1]]),\n                           data.frame(proportion_clicks = proportion_clicks[[2]], n_visitors = n_visitors[[2]])),\n  \n  posterior         = list(prior[[1]][prior[[1]]$n_visitors == 13, ],\n                           prior[[2]][prior[[2]]$n_visitors == 6, ])\n  \n) |> \n  pivot_longer(cols = c(prior, posterior), names_to = \"distribution\", values_to = \"data\") |> \n  mutate(color = c(\"palegreen\", \"chartreuse4\", \"coral1\", \"red1\"),\n         title =c(\"Video prior\", \"Video posterior (13 / 100)\", \"Text prior\", \"Text posterior (6 / 100\"))\n\n\n# 2.

What we would want is to compare the performance of the text and video ads in such a way that we got out a new probability distribution showing the probable difference. And this is easy to get, especially since these two distributions are represented by long vectors of samples.\n\nHere I’ve taken the samples that make up these two probability distributions, given them the names `video_prop` and `text_prop`, prop as in proportion, and put them into a data frame called posterior. \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmin_length <-

The whole vector of samples in prop_diff now represents the posterior probability distribution over the difference between video ads and text ads. So how does this distribution look? Well, you’ll find out in the steps!\n\n## Fit the model using another dataset\n\nLet's fit the binomial model to both the video ad data (13 out of 100 clicked) and the new text ad data (6 out of a 100 clicked).\n\n**Steps**\n\nWe are using the model we have developed in the last section. \n\n1. Calculate `posterior_video` (the posterior proportion of clicks for the video ad data) and `posterior_text` in the same way (using the text ad data instead).\n2. Plot `posterior_text` as a histogram just as `posterior_video` is plotted.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Define parameters\nn_draws <- 100000\nn_ads_shown <- 100\nproportion_clicks <- runif(n_draws, min = 0.0, max = 0.2)\nn_visitors <- rbinom(n = n_draws, size = n_ads_shown, \n                     prob = proportion_clicks)\nprior <- data.frame(proportion_clicks, n_visitors)\n\n# Create the posteriors for video and text ads\nposterior_video <- prior[prior$n_visitors == 13, ]\nposterior_text  <- prior[prior$n_visitors == 6, ]\n\n# Visualize the posteriors\npar(mfrow=c(1,2))\nhist(posterior_video$proportion_clicks, xlim = c(0, 0.25))\nhist(posterior_text$proportion_clicks,  xlim = c(0, 0.25))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](19_fundamentals_of_bayesian_data_analysis_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-55-1.png){fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n> *Question*\n> ---\n> Looking at the histogram of `posterior_text` what can be said about the value of the proportion of clicks for the text ad?<br>\n> <br>\n> ✅ It's likely between 0.03 and 0.13.<br>\n> ⬜ It's likely between 0.10 and 0.15.<br>\n> ⬜ It's exactly 0.06.<br>\n> ⬜ It's likely between 0.06 and 0.10<br>\n\nThat seems about right! Since we have so little data, the estimate is pretty uncertain.\n\n## Calculating the posterior difference\n\nThe posterior `proportion_clicks` for the video and text ad has been put into a single `posterior` data frame. The reason for `[1:4000]` is because these `proportion_clicks`s are not necessarily of the same length, which they need to be when put into a data frame. \n\nNow it's time to calculate the posterior probability distribution over what the difference in proportion of clicks might be between the video ad and the text ad.\n\n**Steps**\n\n1. Add a new column `posterior$prop_diff` that should be the posterior difference between `video_prop` and `text_prop` (that is, `video_prop` *minus* `text_prop`). \n2. Plot `posterior$prop_diff` as a histogram using `hist()`.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nposterior <- data.frame(video_prop = posterior_video$proportion_clicks[1:4000],\n                        text_prop  = posterior_text$proportion_click[1:4000])\n\n# Calculate the posterior difference: video_prop - text_prop\nposterior$prop_diff <- posterior$video_prop - posterior$text_prop \n\n# Visualize prop_diff\nhist(posterior$prop_diff)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](19_fundamentals_of_bayesian_data_analysis_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-56-1.png){fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n3.

And it’s generally the case that it’s easy to calculate any derivative quantities once we’ve fitted a Bayesian model and gotten out posteriors. \n\nGiven a probability distribution over some interesting parameter you calculated a point estimate: A single value summarizing the whole distribution. You did the posterior median, but could also have calculated, say, the posterior mean. It’s important to remember that the posterior median or mean are not the same as the median or mean of the data. The posterior median is a summary of a probability distribution over some parameter, while the median of the data is a summary of a data set. Two different things.

A probability distribution over an interesting parameter**\n\nAnd while you didn’t, you could also have calculated a credible interval, an interval that contains the underlying parameter with a certain probability, for example,\n\n**5. A probability distribution over an interesting parameter**\n\nhere is an 80% credible interval for this probability distribution calculated using the quantile function. So these are some of the things commonly calculated after having fitted a Bayesian model, but we can go further, and a third reason\n\n**6. Next up on reasons to use Bayesian data analysis**\n\nBayes is useful is because you can use the result of a Bayesian analysis to do Decision Analysis. So what’s decision analysis here? Simply put, it’s when you take the result of a statistical analysis and post-process it to make it more about what you really care about, in order to make informed decisions. Often, you don’t really care about the values of parameters. What you really care about is to save the most lives or to make the most money. In the case of your zombie website you definitely care about money, the reason you want more visitors to your site is that you want them to buy\n\n**7. A patented zombie repellent**\n\nyour patented zombie repellent. You’ve tried both video and text ads and now you have to decide which to use for a larger campaign you’re planning.\n\n**8. Video vs text - posteriors**\n\nLooking at the posteriors for the underlying proportion of clicks, there is pretty strong evidence that video ads would give the most visitors per ad shown, but will they result in the most money? Let’s do\n\n**9. A small decision analysis**\n\na small decision analysis to figure that out. The important numbers to know for this is that the social media site charges 25 cents for a video ad, 5 cents for a text ad, and based on historical data we make 2-point-53 dollars per visitor on average. Let’s again work directly with\n\n**10. A small decision analysis**\n\nthe posterior samples. So we can calculate anything row-wise, and the resulting distribution will be correct. Let’s start by\n\n**11. A small decision analysis**\n\nhow much we earn on average per shown video ad. This is then the proportion of people that will click times how much we’ll make on average per visitor minus the cost of showing the ad. Looking at the first row we see that if the underlying proportion of clicks actually was 0-point-08, you would lose 4 cents on average per ad, but it seems for most samples, you’ll make a profit.\n\n**12. A small decision analysis**\n\nWe can calculate the text ad profit in the same way, but this time subtracting the cost of a text ad instead. And finally, we can calculate\n\n**13. A small decision analysis**\n\nprofit_diff, the probability distribution over the profit difference between video and text ads. This distribution is now much closer to what we really care about: which type of ad will give us the most money, where a positive number is in favor of video ads and a negative number in favor of text ads. We could now use profit_diff directly to\n\n**14. Make a data informed decision!**\n\nmake a data-informed decision, so what is that decision?

Video vs text - Posterior difference**\n\nthe probability distribution over the difference in profit between using video and text ads. This was all pretty easy to do, and the surprising result was that, if forced to choose, you should actually go for text ads. But what this distribution is also telling you is that there is large uncertainty over which type of ad is the best, and you really should get some more data before you make a decision. So you’ve already seen that it is easy to tweak the prior of a Bayesian model, but\n\n**4. Next up on reasons to use Bayesian data analysis**\n\nthe fourth reason to use Bayes is that you can also completely change the underlying statistical model, often with not too much effort. Let’s take a look at an example where you will\n\n**5. Completely switch out the binomial model**\n\ncompletely switch out the binomial model we have worked with so far. Why would you want to do that? Well, you have some new data to analyze, where the Binomial model isn’t going to work well. See, you happen to have a friend, also in the zombie e-commerce business, and she has offered to put up an ad for your site as a banner on her site, for a small daily fee, of course. The thing is, you wouldn’t pay per view, the banner is always up, you would pay per day. As a trial, she already put it up on her site for just one day, and during that time it resulted in 19 clicks and visits to your site. The question is: How many daily site visits, should we expect, on average, if we pay for this banner? Now it’s obvious that the binomial model won’t directly work here, it models the number of successes out of a total number of shown ads, but now the ad is shown all the time, and we just have\n\n**6. A model for counts per day**\n\na daily count. What we could do is that we split each day into minutes and assume some unknown proportion of minutes results in a success, a click on the ad. One problem with this generative model is that it can’t model more than one click per minute, either it’s a success or not. We could, sort of, fix this by\n\n**7. A model for counts per day**\n\nsplitting the day into seconds instead,\n\n**8. A model for counts per day**\n\nor why not milliseconds,\n\n**9. A model for counts per day**\n\nor even smaller. In the limit, we end up with another generative model that also has a name:\n\n**10. The Poisson distribution**\n\nthe Poisson process or the Poisson distribution. It has one parameter: The mean number of events per measured time unit, in this case, it’s the number of clicks per day. In R you can sample from the Poisson distribution using the rpois function, and just like with the rbinom function you can plug in different parameter values and use it to generate simulated data.\n\n**11. The Poisson distribution**\n\nFor example, if we knew that the mean number of clicks per day was 20, then this would give you the probability distribution over how many clicks you would expect to get, say, tomorrow. Now, of course, for the banner ad we don’t know the underlying mean number of clicks, so\n\n**12. Let's find out in the exercises!**\n\nlet’s try to find that out in the next couple of exercises by completely replacing the Bayesian binomial model by a Poisson model instead.\n\n## The Poisson distribution\n\nThe Poisson distribution simulates a process where the outcome is a number of occurrences per day/year/area/unit/etc. Before using it in a Bayesian model, let's explore it!\n\n**Steps**\n\n1. The Poisson distribution has one parameter, the average number of events per unit. In R you can simulate from a Poisson distribution using `rpois` where `lambda` is the average number of occurrences:\n\n    * Use the code above to simulate 10000 draws from a Poisson distribution, assign the result to `x`. \n    * Visualize `x` using a histogram (`hist()`).\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Simulate from a Poisson distribution and visualize the result\nx <- rpois(n = 10000, lambda = 3)\nhist(x)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](19_fundamentals_of_bayesian_data_analysis_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-66-1.png){fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n2. Let's say that you run an ice cream stand and on cloudy days you on average sell 11.5 ice creams.

It's still a cloudy day, and unfortunately, you won't break even unless you sell 15 or more ice creams. \n\n    * Assuming the Poisson model is reasonable, use `x` to calculate the probability that you'll break even.\n4. *Tip*: For this, you need to calculate what proportion of samples in `x` are `>= 15`.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Simulate from a Poisson distribution and visualize the result\nx <- rpois(n = 10000, lambda = 11.5)\nhist(x)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](19_fundamentals_of_bayesian_data_analysis_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-68-1.png){fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Calculate the probability of break-even\nmean(x >= 15)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n#> [1] 0.1899\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n> *Question*\n> ---\n> Is it likely that you will break even on a cloudy day, or should you stay at home?<br>\n> <br>\n> ⬜ Let's go out and sell ice cream!<br>\n> ✅ Let's stay at home and wait for a sunny day.<br>\n\nThis is a legitimate decision boundary as it lies in the gap between the clusters. Try again.\n\n## Clicks per day instead of clicks per ad\n\nWhen you put up a banner on your friend's site you got 19 clicks in a day, how many daily clicks should you expect this banner to generate on average? Now, modify your model, *one piece at a time*, to calculate this.\n\n**Steps**\n\n1. To the right is the old code for the binomial Bayesian model. To accommodate the new banner data you're now going to change the model so that it uses a Poisson distribution instead.\n\n    * Start by replacing the prior distribution over `proportion_clicks` by a prior over `mean_clicks`. Make the prior a uniform (`runif`) distribution from `0` to `80` clicks per day.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Replace proportion_clicks with mean_clicks and change the parameters\nn_draws <- 100000\nn_ads_shown <- 100\nmean_clicks <- runif(n_draws, min = 0, max = 80)\nn_visitors <- rbinom(n_draws, size = n_ads_shown, \n                     prob = proportion_clicks)\n                     \nprior <- data.frame(proportion_clicks, n_visitors)\nposterior <- prior[prior$n_visitors == 13, ]\n```\n:::\n\n\n2. Now, change the model for `n_visitors`. Instead of assuming a binomial distribution, let's assume a Poisson: \n\n    * Replace `rbinom` with `rpois` where you still draw `n_draws` samples, but where the second argument now is `mean_clicks`. Remember that the second argument to `rpois` is called `lambda=` and that you need to remove the third unused `prob` argument.\n    * Replace `proportion_clicks` everywhere by `mean_clicks` and remove `n_ads_shown`.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Change this model so that it uses a Poisson distribution\nn_draws <- 100000\nmean_clicks <- runif(n_draws, min = 0, max = 80)\nn_visitors <- rpois(n = n_draws, mean_clicks)\n\nprior <- data.frame(mean_clicks, n_visitors)\nposterior <- prior[prior$n_visitors == 13, ]\n```\n:::\n\n\n3. Nice! But you're still using the wrong data. \n\n    * The banner got 19 clicks in a day, not 13, so change it. \n    * Plot histograms of  `prior$mean_clicks` and `posterior$mean_clicks`.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Change the model according to instructions\nn_draws <- 100000\nmean_clicks <- runif(n_draws, min = 0, max = 80)\nn_visitors <- rpois(n = n_draws, mean_clicks)\n\nprior <- data.frame(mean_clicks, n_visitors)\nposterior <- prior[prior$n_visitors == 19, ]\n\nhist(prior$mean_clicks)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](19_fundamentals_of_bayesian_data_analysis_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-71-1.png){fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhist(posterior$mean_clicks)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](19_fundamentals_of_bayesian_data_analysis_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-71-2.png){fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n> *Question*\n> ---\n> The model is complete!

Try again.\n\n## Bayes is optimal, kind of...\n\nTheory. Coming soon ...\n\n\n**1. You just replaced the whole model!**\n\nYou just replaced the whole Bayesian binomial model completely, by just changing two lines of code, and you didn’t even have to change how the model was fitted!\n\n**2. Banner analysis result**\n\nHere’s the prior and posterior you calculated. Seems like you should expect between 10 and 30 site visits on average because of the banner, and if we knew how much your friend wanted to charge for putting up the banner, we could do a small decision analysis to figure out if it’s worth it. In this chapter you’ve seen\n\n**3. Some ways Bayesian data analysis can be useful**\n\nsome ways Bayesian data analysis can be useful. But in short: Bayes allows you to tweak, change and tinker with the model to better fit the data analytical problem you have. But a last reason to use Bayes is because it is optimal, kind of. It can be shown, theoretically, that no other method learns as efficiently from data as Bayesian inference. The reason I’m saying “kind of” is because this only holds for the small world that is the model. If the data was actually generated by our binomial generative model, then no other method than Bayesian inference could do better. But optimality in the small world of the model doesn’t mean we have any guarantees in the larger world of reality.\n\n**4. The binomial model for the ad data**\n\nTake, for example, the model we used for the ad data. One assumption was that the underlying proportion of success could be anything between 0% and 20%, but if it actually would be more than 20%, if your ad is hugely successful, then the model will never get this right, no matter the amount of data. Or if there are time effects, maybe people click more on video adds in the winter, then the model will also never capture that. This is not unique to Bayes, no statistical model can ever be optimal in the real world, but at least it’s nice to know that\n\n**5. Nice properties of Bayes**\n\nBayes is optimal in the small world defined by the model. In the last exercise, you saw that you could completely replace a Bayesian model without changing how you fitted it. This highlights another nice property of Bayesian data analysis: There is a separation between model and computation. That’s not to say that computation is not an issue, and the method we’ve used so far is impractical for everything but the most simple models.\n\n**6. Next up: How to fit Bayesian models more efficiently!**\n\nSo in the next chapter, we’re going to learn how to fit Bayesian models more efficiently, unfortunately, this will require a little bit of probability theory, but on the upside, you’ll get to learn what Bayes theorem is all about!\n\n# 4. Bayesian inference with Bayes' theorem\n\nLearn what Bayes theorem is all about and how to use it for statistical inference.\n\n## Probability rules\n\nTheory. Coming soon ...\n\n\n**1.

Bad and good news**\n\nthe bad news is that this computational method scales horribly, both with larger data sets and with more complicated models. But there are two pieces of good news. First, Bayesian computation is a hot research topic, and there are tons of skilled scientists out there working hard on new methods to allow you to fit Bayesian models more efficiently. Second, the result of using a more efficient method will still be the same as if you had used the slower method, as the Bayesian model is still the same, so everything you’ve learned so far still applies. The only difference is that with a faster method you’ll get the result now rather than in a hundred years. To work with and understand faster computational methods one does need to know a bit about\n\n**5. Probability theory**\n\nprobability theory. So, a probability was a number between zero and one which we use to state the certainty or uncertainty of propositions / parameters / future data, etc. A mathematical notation that is sometimes used is the following. Here the P stands for probability, and this simply means: the probability of the number of visitors being equal to 13. Now, a probability distribution was an allocation of probability over many mutually exclusive outcomes and if you just write P(n_visitors). This refers to the probability distribution over all possible numbers of visitors. In statistics it’s common to talk about conditional probability, that is, the probability of this given that we know that. In probability notation, this is written with a vertical bar, so this means; The probability of getting 13 visitors given that the proportion of clicks is 10%. This is a single probability. But it also works with probability distributions, so this denotes the conditional probability distribution of the probability over the possible numbers of visitors given that the proportion of clicks is 10%. That is, this refers to\n\n**6. P(n_visitors | prop_clicks = 10%)**\n\nthe same probability distributions as you simulated before. Finally, you can\n\n**7. Manipulating probability**\n\nmanipulate and combine probabilities using addition and multiplication. The first basic rule is\n\n**8. Manipulating probability**\n\nthe sum rule. If two possible outcomes are mutually exclusive then we can sum up their probability to get the total probability that either or will be the outcome. For example,\n\n**9. Manipulating probability**\n\nthe probability of getting a 1 or 2 or 3 when rolling a die is\n\n**10. Manipulating probability**\n\n1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6. That is, there is a 50% probability. The second basic rule is\n\n**11. Manipulating probability**\n\nthe product rule: If two possible outcomes are unrelated or independent, then we can multiply their probabilities to get the probability that both will be the actual outcome. For example,\n\n**12. Manipulating probability**\n\nthe probability of rolling a six with one die and a six with another die is\n\n**13. Manipulating probability**\n\n1/6 times 1/6, that is, a 2.8% probability. This was all the probability notation and basic rules you’ll need for now.\n\n**14. Manipulating probability**\n\nIf you want to dig deeper I really recommend that you take a look at Dave Robinson’s DataCamp course \"Foundations of Probability in R\".\n\n**15. Let's try out these rules!**\n\nBut for now let’s try out these rules in a couple of exercises.\n\n## Cards and the sum rule\n\nA standard French-suited deck of playing cards contains 52 cards; 13 each of hearts (♥), spades (♠), clubs (♦), and diamonds (♣). \nAssuming that you have a well-shuffled deck in front of you, the probability of drawing any given card is `1/52` ≈ 1.92%.\n\n**Steps**\n\n1. Calculate the probability of drawing any of the four aces! That is, calculate the probability of drawing 🂡 or 🂱 or 🃁 or 🃑 using the sum rule and assign it to `prob_to_draw_ace`.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Calculate the probability of drawing any of the four aces\nprob_to_draw_ace <- 1/52 + 1/52 + 1/52 + 1/52\n```\n:::\n\n\nYes! The probability to draw an ace is 1/52 + 1/52 + 1/52 + 1/52 = 4/52 = 7.7% .\n\n## Cards and the product rule\n\nAgain, assuming that you have a well-shuffled deck in front of you, the probability of drawing any given card is `1/52` ≈ 1.92% . The probability of drawing any of the four aces is `1/52 + 1/52 + 1/52 + 1/52` = `4/52`. Once an ace has been drawn, the probability of picking any of the remaining three is `3/51`. If another ace is drawn the probability of picking any of the remaining two is `2/50`, and so on.\n\n**Steps**\n\n1. Use the product rule to calculate the probability of picking the four aces in a row from the top of a well-shuffled deck and assign it to `prob_to_draw_four_aces`.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Calculate the probability of picking four aces in a row\nprob_to_draw_four_aces <- 4/52 * 3/51 * 2/50 * 1/49\n```\n:::\n\n\nYes! The probability to draw four aces is 4/52 * 3/51 * 2/50 * 1/49 = 0.0004%. Pretty unlikely!\n\n## Calculating likelihoods\n\nTheory. Coming soon ...\n\n\n**1. We can calculate!**\n\nSo we can calculate new probabilities using the sum and the product rules. But in earlier chapters we didn’t calculate probabilities directly, we simulated.\n\n**2. Simulation vs calculation**\n\nIf we wanted to figure out the probability that a generative model would generate a certain value, we simulated a large number of samples and then counted the proportion of samples taking on this certain value. This was easy to do for generative models that correspond to common probability distributions, like the binomial or the Poisson distribution, as you can use the “r”-functions, like rbinom and rpois for this. For example, here is how we got p(n_visitors = 13 | prob_success = 10%), the probability that 13 out of a 100 would visit your site if the underlying proportion of clicks was 10%. But one thing that faster Bayesian computational methods have in common is that they require that this probability can be calculated directly rather than simulated. Fortunately, for these common distributions someone already figured out how to do this and in R we can use the “d”-functions, like dbinom and dpois, for this. Using dbinom we can directly calculate the probability that 13 out of a 100 would visit your site, like this. This is obviously much more efficient than to have to generate 100,000 or so samples first. We can manipulate the resulting probabilities using the rules we just learned. For example,\n\n**3. Simulation vs calculation**\n\nthe probability of getting 13 or 14 visitors would be 12.6% percent. Here calculated using the sum rule. Finally, if we want to get a whole probability distribution, we’ll have to calculate the probability for a range of values. But the d-functions are generally vectorized, so that is easy! If we wanted the probability distribution over the number of visitors we would expect conditional on the proportion of success being 10% we could calculate it like this. Instead of the resulting probability distribution being represented by a large number of samples, as in earlier chapters, it’s now represented by a vector giving the probability of each outcome. And we can plot it like this.\n\n**4. Plotting a calculated distribution**\n\nThe binomial is an example of a discrete distribution; it defines probability over whole numbers: 1, 2, 3, and so on. But there are also\n\n**5. Continuous distributions**\n\ncontinuous distributions, and earlier we used the uniform distribution like this. There is also a d-version of runif: dunif,\n\n**6. Continuous distributions**\n\nand you might expect that this would return the probability of the outcome being 0.12 assuming a uniform distribution between 0 and 0.2. But it does not. For starters, a probability can at most be 1, and here we got a 5 back. That’s because for continuous distributions you can’t really talk about the probability of a single value, the probability of getting exactly 0.12 is effectively zero. So instead you get the probability density, a number that on its own doesn’t tell you much, but that you can view as a relative probability: A value with twice the probability density as another value is twice as probable. This is also where the d in dunif and dbinom comes from, it stands for density. Since we’re here using uniform distribution, we should not be surprised that any value between 0 and 0.2 returns the same number: 5. Within a uniform probability distribution, any value is equally likely.\n\n**7. Try this out!**\n\nNow, try out what I’ve shown you here in some exercises.\n\n## From rbinom to dbinom\n\nTo the right is currently code that \n\n1. Simulates the number of clicks/visitors (n_clicks) from 100 shown ads using the rbinom function given that the underlying proportion of clicks is 10%.\n2. Calculates the probability of getting 13 visitors (prob_13_visitors). \n\nThat is, in probability notation it's calculating P(`n_visitors` = 13 | `proportion_clicks` = 10%).\n\n**Steps**\n\n1. First, try running this code.\n2. Then, rewrite this code so that it calculates `prob_13_visitors` using `dbinom` instead.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Rewrite this code so that it uses dbinom instead of rbinom\nn_ads_shown <- 100\nproportion_clicks <- 0.1\nprob_13_visitors <- dbinom(13, \n    size = n_ads_shown, prob = proportion_clicks)\nprob_13_visitors\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n#> [1] 0.07430209\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAlright! You got a similar result as with rbinom, but dbinom is much more efficient!\n\n## Calculating probabilities with dbinom\n\nTo the right is roughly the code you ended up with in the last exercise.\n\n**Steps**\n\n1. Currently the code calculates P(`n_visitors = 13` | `proportion_clicks` = 10%): The probability of getting 13 visitors *given* that the proportion of clicks is 10%. \n\n    * Change the code to instead calculate P(`n_visitors` | `proportion_clicks` = 10%): The probability distribution over all possible numbers of visitors.\n2. *Tip*: As `dbinom` is vectorized it suffices to change the value of `n_visitors` into a vector with the numbers 0, 1, 2, …, 100. Try using the `seq` function!\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Explore using dbinom to calculate probability distributions\nn_ads_shown <- 100\nproportion_clicks <- 0.1\nn_visitors <- seq(0, 100, by = 1)\nprob <- dbinom(n_visitors, \n    size = n_ads_shown, prob = proportion_clicks)\nprob\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n#>   [1]  2.656140e-05  2.951267e-04  1.623197e-03  5.891602e-03  1.587460e-02\n#>   [6]  3.386580e-02  5.957873e-02  8.889525e-02  1.148230e-01  1.304163e-01\n#>  [11]  1.318653e-01  1.198776e-01  9.878801e-02  7.430209e-02  5.130383e-02\n#>  [16]  3.268244e-02  1.929172e-02  1.059153e-02  5.426525e-03  2.602193e-03\n#>  [21]  1.170987e-03  4.956559e-04  1.977617e-04  7.451890e-05  2.656461e-05\n#>  [26]  8.972934e-06  2.875940e-06  8.758007e-07  2.537042e-07  6.998736e-08\n#>  [31]  1.840408e-08  4.617512e-09  1.106279e-09  2.532895e-10  5.545880e-11\n#>  [36]  1.161994e-11  2.331161e-12  4.480309e-13  8.253201e-14  1.457830e-14\n#>  [41]  2.470212e-15  4.016606e-16  6.269305e-17  9.395858e-18  1.352434e-18\n#>  [46]  1.870032e-19  2.484342e-20  3.171501e-21  3.890962e-22  4.587982e-23\n#>  [51]  5.199713e-24  5.664175e-25  5.930440e-26  5.967739e-27  5.771270e-28\n#>  [56]  5.363200e-29  4.788572e-30  4.107157e-31  3.383290e-32  2.676049e-33\n#>  [61]  2.031815e-34  1.480375e-35  1.034671e-36  6.934301e-38  4.454325e-39\n#>  [66]  2.741123e-40  1.615140e-41  9.106926e-43  4.910597e-44  2.530420e-45\n#>  [71]  1.245128e-46  5.845669e-48  2.616117e-49  1.114936e-50  4.520010e-52\n#>  [76]  1.741041e-53  6.363454e-55  2.203794e-56  7.220406e-58  2.234162e-59\n#>  [81]  6.516307e-61  1.787738e-62  4.602579e-64  1.109055e-65  2.493907e-67\n#>  [86]  5.216014e-69  1.010856e-70  1.807405e-72  2.966699e-74  4.444493e-76\n#>  [91]  6.035732e-78  7.369636e-80  8.010474e-82  7.656367e-84  6.335055e-86\n#>  [96]  4.445653e-88  2.572716e-90  1.178793e-92  4.009500e-95  9.000000e-98\n#> [101] 1.000000e-100\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n3.

Try again.\n\n## Bayesian calculation\n\nTheory. Coming soon ...\n\n\n**1. Bayesian calculation**\n\nIn chapter two we simulated a large number of samples to end up with\n\n**2. Sampled joint distribution**\n\na joint distribution over the uncertain parameter, the underlying proportion of clicks, and the future data, how many clicks we would get out of a hundred shown ads. Then we conditioned on the data we got,\n\n**3. Conditioned sampled joint distribution**\n\nthirteen clicks, and that allowed the model to become more certain about the underlying proportion of clicks. This, to condition on the data, is what Bayesian inference is. Now, you’ve learned the basic probability rules. You’ve learned how to calculate probabilities and densities using probability distributions. We’re going to put this together to do Bayesian inference.\n\n**4. Bayesian inference by calculation**\n\nBut instead of simulation, as in chapter two, we’ll calculate everything directly in R, but using the same example as in chapter 2. First, let’s state what we know. As before, we know that we’re going to show a 100 ads.\n\n**5. Bayesian inference by calculation**\n\nWhat we don’t know is\n\n**6. Bayesian inference by calculation**\n\nwe can dothe underlying proportion of clicks and the number of clicks and visitors our 100 shown ads will generate. We’re now going to list all possible combinations of these two unknowns. This is easy for n_visitors,\n\n**7. Bayesian inference by calculation**\n\nwe get at least zero and at most hundred. The underlying proportion of clicks is continuous from zero to one so we can't do all combinations but at least we can do\n\n**8. Bayesian inference by calculation**\n\na fine grid of values. We’ll then use the\n\n**9. Bayesian inference by calculation**\n\nexpand.grid function which will generate all possible combinations of n_visitors and proportion_clicks, and put them neatly into a data frame called pars, as in parameters. Shown in the table here is just a sample from pars, but pars really lists every combination of proportion_clicks and n_visitors. Now we’ll add the rest of the model to this data frame. First, the prior for proportion_clicks.\n\n**10. Bayesian inference by calculation**\n\nThis is what we did when we sampled in chapter 2. Now instead we’ll calculate it for each proportion_clicks value in pars:\n\n**11. Bayesian inference by calculation**\n\nAs you can see in the table, it becomes the same density, 5, for each value below 0.2, and is otherwise zero. Then we had the probability distribution over future data, n_visitors, given proportion_clicks.\n\n**12. Bayesian inference by calculation**\n\nWhich looked like this when we sampled. Now, we’ll also calculate this for each row in pars:\n\n**13. Bayesian inference by calculation**\n\nI’m adding it to a new column called “likelihood”, as this quantity is often just called the “likelihood” of the data. Finally, we’re ready to calculate the probability of each proportion_clicks and n_visitors combination. Which is a combination of the likelihood of the data given the parameter value and how likely that parameter value was, to begin with. To calculate the probability of this and that we can use multiplication, so the probability is\n\n**14. Bayesian inference by calculation**\n\nthe likelihood times the prior. Almost. Because the total probability is now\n\n**15. Bayesian inference by calculation**\n\n105. But probability should be a number between 0 and 1,\n\n**16. Bayesian inference by calculation**\n\nso we’ll have to divide what we just calculated by the total sum, to normalize it into a probability distribution.\n\n**17. Bayesian inference by calculation**\n\nThere, that fixed it. In chapter two, after having done all that sampling, we ended up with\n\n**18. Sampled joint plot**\n\nthis probability distribution. Now, after all this calculation, if we plot the probability of each proportion_clicks and n_visitors combination, we get this:\n\n**19. Calculated joint plot**\n\nPretty similar, right? Finally, let’s bring in the actual data.\n\n**20. Bayesian inference by calculation**\n\nAs there were 13 clicks out of a hundred shown ads, we can now\n\n**21. Bayesian inference by calculation**\n\nremove all rows where n_visitors is something else. And while we’re at it we’ll normalize again, to make sure the remaining probabilities sum to one. Here’s the result:\n\n**22. Calculated marginal joint distributions**\n\nIf we now zoom in on this slice and plot from the side, instead of looking at it from above,\n\n**23. Marginal distribution: simulated vs. sampled 1**\n\nwe see that we have retrieved the same probability distribution over the likely underlying proportions of clicks as we got when we simulated in chapter two.\n\n**24. Marginal distribution: simulated vs. sampled 2**\n\nBut running the simulation is much slower on my computer than calculating it directly! That was a lot of calculation,\n\n**25. Calculate for yourself!**\n\nbut it’s not over because now you get to try it out yourself in a couple of exercises!\n\n## Calculating a joint distribution\n\nTo the right, you have parts of the code we developed in the last video. It defines a grid over the underlying proportions of clicks (`proportion_clicks`) and possible outcomes (`n_visitors`) in `pars`. It adds to it the `prior` probability of each parameter combination and the likelihood that each `proportion_clicks` would generate the corresponding `n_visitors`.\n\n**Steps**\n\n1. Add the column `pars$probability`: The probability of each `proportion_clicks` and `n_visitors` combination. As in the video, this should be calculated by multiplying the `likelihood` by the `prior`\n2. Make sure the column `pars$probability` sums to `1.0` by *normalizing* it, that is, by dividing `pars$probability` by the total sum of `pars$probability`.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nn_ads_shown <- 100\nproportion_clicks <- seq(0, 1, by = 0.01)\nn_visitors <- seq(0, 100, by = 1)\npars <- expand.grid(proportion_clicks = proportion_clicks,\n                    n_visitors = n_visitors)\npars$prior <- dunif(pars$proportion_clicks, min = 0, max = 0.2)\npars$likelihood <- dbinom(pars$n_visitors, \n    size = n_ads_shown, prob = pars$proportion_clicks)\n\n# Add the column pars$probability and normalize it\npars$probability <- pars$likelihood * pars$prior\npars$probability <- pars$probability / sum(pars$probability)\n```\n:::\n\n\nNicely calculated and normalized!\n\n## Conditioning on the data (again)\n\nLet's resurrect the zombie site example where you tested text ads. Out of a 100 impressions of the text ad, 6 out of a 100 clicked and visited your site. \n\nTo the right is roughly the code you developed in the last exercise. `pars` is currently the joint distribution over all combinations of `proportion_clicks` and `n_visitors`.\n\n**Steps**\n\n1. Condition on the data and keep only the rows in `pars` where `n_visitors == 6`.\n2. Normalize `pars$probability` again, to make sure it sums to `1.0`.\n3. Plot the posterior `pars$probability` using `plot(x = , y = , type = \"h\")` with `pars$proportion_clicks` on the x-axis and `pars$probability` on the y-axis.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nn_ads_shown <- 100\nproportion_clicks <- seq(0, 1, by = 0.01)\nn_visitors <- seq(0, 100, by = 1)\npars <- expand.grid(proportion_clicks = proportion_clicks,\n                    n_visitors = n_visitors)\npars$prior <- dunif(pars$proportion_clicks, min = 0, max = 0.2)\npars$likelihood <- dbinom(pars$n_visitors, \n    size = n_ads_shown, prob = pars$proportion_clicks)\npars$probability <- pars$likelihood * pars$prior\npars$probability <- pars$probability / sum(pars$probability)\n# Condition on the data \npars <- pars[pars$n_visitors == 6, ]\n# Normalize again\npars$probability <- pars$probability / sum(pars$probability)\n# Plot the posterior pars$probability\nplot(pars$proportion_clicks, pars$probability, type = \"h\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](19_fundamentals_of_bayesian_data_analysis_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-79-1.png){fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nCool! You have now calculated (rather than simulated) your first posterior probability distribution!\n\n## A conditional shortcut\n\nGreat, you've now done some Bayesian computation, without doing any simulation! The plot you produced should be similar to the posterior distribution you calculated in chapter 3. However, if you look to the right you see that it required an awful lot of code, isn't there anything we can cut?\n\nYes, there is! You can directly condition on the data, no need to first create the joint distribution.\n\n**Steps**\n\n1. Set `n_visitors` directly to `6`, just replace the `seq`-statement.\n2. Now you can remove the line that conditions on the data, and the line after that, that normalizes `pars$probability`.\n3. Take an extra look at the final code and convince yourself that the result of this modified code will be the same as before. :)\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Simplify the code below by directly conditioning on the data\nn_ads_shown <- 100\nproportion_clicks <- seq(0, 1, by = 0.01)\nn_visitors <- 6\npars <- expand.grid(proportion_clicks = proportion_clicks)\npars$prior <- dunif(pars$proportion_clicks, min = 0, max = 0.2) \npars$likelihood <- dbinom(n_visitors, \n    size = n_ads_shown, prob = pars$proportion_clicks)\npars$probability <- pars$likelihood * pars$prior\npars$probability <- pars$probability / sum(pars$probability)\nplot(pars$proportion_clicks, pars$probability, type = \"h\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](19_fundamentals_of_bayesian_data_analysis_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-80-1.png){fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nUnnecessary lines are removed, the code is easier to read, and the program runs quicker!

But you know what? You’ve already used it! This\n\n**2. This is Bayes' theorem!**\n\npiece of code is an example of Bayes theorem! Let’s rewrite it into probability notation so that it feels more “official”. We calculated\n\n**3. This is Bayes' theorem!**\n\nthe probability of different parameter values given some new data. And this is what it says here, the O with the bar is the Greek letter theta, which is often used to represent parameters, the capital D is the data. And this just reads “the probability of the parameters theta given the data D”. Ok, this we calculate as\n\n**4. This is Bayes' theorem!**\n\nthe likelihood, which was the probability (or sometimes, relative probability) of the data given different parameter values,\n\n**5. This is Bayes' theorem!**\n\ntimes the prior, which was the probability of different parameters theta, given nothing, that is, before seeing the data. And finally, we needed to normalize this so that the sum of all the probabilities over different parameter values totaled one. That is,\n\n**6. This is Bayes' theorem!**\n\nwe divided by the total sum of the likelihood, weighted by the prior. So this equation here is Bayes theorem!\n\n**7. This is Bayes' theorem!**\n\nBut it just describes what you calculated yourself in the previous exercise. The technique you used, last exercise, to fit the model is often called\n\n**8. Grid approximation**\n\ngrid approximation. Grid, because you define a grid over all the parameter combinations you need to evaluate, and approximation because you often cannot try all parameter combinations, like when you have a continuous parameter, so you have to settle for a hopefully representative subset. But in the first chapter, we used sampling to fit the very same model. So two very different algorithms that in the end gives the same result and fits the same model. And it’s actually the case that there are many more algorithms to fit Bayesian models, some more efficient than others. But as the model, and the result of fitting the model, stays the same, there is\n\n**9. A mathematical notation for models**\n\na mathematical notation used to define only the model, leaving it open what algorithm is used to fit the model. The binomial model we’ve used so far could be written like this: The number of shown adds is fixed to 100. p_clicks, the underlying probability of a click, is uncertain, and the model assumes it could be anything from zero to 0-point-2. That is, p_clicks is distributed, the little tilde or squiggly character is read as “is distributed”, as a Uniform distribution between zero and 0-point-2. n_visitors is also uncertain, and the model assumes n_visitors is distributed as a binomial distribution with n_ads trials with a p_clicks proportion of success. This notation, informally called tilde-notation, can be found in many Bayesian books and papers, and is a convenient way of defining the model without going into computational details. This model has one data point and one parameter. But in the next, last chapter\n\n**10. Up next: More parameters, more data!**\n\nwe’re going to raise the stakes! And take a look at a two-parameter model with many more data points. But, as this whole course has been focusing on the basics of Bayes, and it might feel like we’re taking baby steps, you’ll also get to try a Bayesian tool that you as a Data Scientist could use in production.\n\n## A Poisson model description\n\nAt the end of last chapter you tweaked the binomial model into a Poisson model using the following R code:\n\n\n<pre><code class=\"R language-R\">n_draws <- 100000\nmean_clicks <- runif(n_draws, min = 0, max = 80)\nn_visitors <- rpois(n = n_draws, mean_clicks)\n```\n\nWhich of the following mathematical model descriptions best describe this model?\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/1300/datasets/d427717e53e3d72da4f01c6296889092903073ca/tilde_abcd_alternatives.png\" width=\"75%\">\n\n\n> *Question*\n> ---\n> ???<br>\n> <br>\n> ✅ A<br>\n> ⬜ B<br>\n> ⬜ C<br>\n> ⬜ D<br>\n\nYes, that's right!\n\n# 5.

A Bayesian model of water temperature**\n\nOk, let’s use the normal distribution to build a Bayesian model for the temperature data, to figure out if I should have my beach party or not. Before coding this up, let’s write down the model using the tilde-notation we looked at last chapter. So we had a number of\n\n**2. Let's define the model**\n\nwater temperatures from five 20th of Julys, and we’re going to model them as coming from\n\n**3. Let's define the model**\n\na normal distribution with some unknown mean mu, and unknown standard deviation sigma. Finally, we need to specify what the model knows about these two parameters before, prior to, being informed by the data, we need to define prior probability distributions. I would say that\n\n**4. Let's define the model**\n\nthe standard deviation should be somewhere between 0 and 10, given what I know about Swedish water temperatures. The typical summer water temperature would be something around 18 degrees Celsius plus-minus 5. To represent this information\n\n**5. Let's define the model**\n\nwe could use another normal distribution centered on 18, with a standard deviation of 5 as the prior for mu. We could have used many other priors, but let's go with this for now! Now we need to fit this model, and as in last chapter we’re going to use grid approximation. Let’s pull up the code from last chapter.\n\n**6. Let's fit the model**\n\nand let’s change this to fit the new normal model. We’re no longer dealing with ads, but with temperature, so let’s change that:\n\n**7. Let's fit the model**\n\nThe unknown parameter is not proportions of clicks, it’s\n\n**8. Let's fit the model**\n\nthe mean mu and the standard deviation sigma of the normal distribution and we want to define a grid over these two parameters that is wide and fine-grained enough.\n\n**9. Let's fit the model**\n\nHere I’m going with a grid over mu from 8 to 30 degrees, in steps of half degrees, and for sigma I go with 0.1 to 10 by steps of 0.3. Then we’ll use these two vectors with the expand.grid function to create a data frame that lists all possible combinations of parameters:\n\n**10. Let's fit the model**\n\nNow we have defined a grid over, hopefully, the relevant parts of parameter space. What’s parameter space? Well, It’s the space of all possible parameter combinations.\n\n**11. The parameter space**\n\nHere is what we have right now. A two-dimensional parameter space, where each dot here is one of the parameter combinations in pars. Having that we now need to define the right priors and likelihoods.\n\n**12. Let's fit the model**\n\nThe prior over mu\n\n**13. Let's fit the model**\n\nwas a normal distribution with mean 18 and standard deviation 5,\n\n**14. Let's fit the model**\n\nthe prior over sigma was uniform from zero and ten. And finally, we can just\n\n**15. Let's fit the model**\n\nmultiply these together to get a combined prior. The likelihood of the data given the parameters needs to be calculated for each parameter combination. So,\n\n**16. Let's fit the model**\n\nfor each row i in pars we’ll calculate\n\n**17. Let's fit the model**\n\nthe likelihoods of the data points assuming a normal distribution, and\n\n**18. Let's fit the model**\n\nthen we’ll multiply these likelihoods together to get the combined likelihood of the five data points. The last part would be to calculate the posterior probability of each parameter combination, but fortunately, Bayes’ theorem stays the same, so we don’t have to change a thing! Now let’s run this, and let’s take a look at the probability distribution we get after, posterior to, having used the data.\n\n**19. The result**\n\nHere it is! Each square in this plot shows the probability of a parameter combination, with more probable parameter combinations having darker colors. Just eyeballing this it looks like the most probable mean temperature should be around 18 to 22 degrees. We’ll take a look at that in more detail soon, but first,\n\n**20. Replicate this analysis using zombie data!**\n\ntake a stab at replicating this analysis in the following exercises, but using some zombie data instead.\n\n## A Bayesian model of Zombie IQ\n\nZombies are stupid, and you and your colleagues at the *National Zombie Research Laboratory* are interested in *how* stupid they are. To the right, you have the Normal model we developed in the last video, but with the temperature data switched out with some zombie IQs fresh from the lab. What we're interested in is how much we can learn about the mean zombie IQ from this data. The model is complete, save for that we need to calculate the `probability` of each parameter combination in `pars`.\n\n**Steps**\n\n1. Use Bayes Theorem to calculate these probabilities and assign them to `pars$probability` to complete the model.\n2. \\\\(\\\\theta\\\\) is a parameter combination, \n3. \\\\(D\\\\) is the data, \n4. \\\\(P(D|\\\\theta)\\\\) is the likelihood\n5. \\\\(P(\\\\theta)\\\\) is the prior\n6. \\\\(P(\\\\theta|D)\\\\) is the probability of different parameter values given the data. This is what we want!\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# The IQ of a bunch of zombies\niq <- c(55, 44, 34, 18, 51, 40, 40, 49, 48, 46)\n# Defining the parameter grid\npars <- expand.grid(mu = seq(0, 150, length.out = 100), \n                    sigma = seq(0.1, 50, length.out = 100))\n# Defining and calculating the prior density for each parameter combination\npars$mu_prior <- dnorm(pars$mu, mean = 100, sd = 100)\npars$sigma_prior <- dunif(pars$sigma, min = 0.1, max = 50)\npars$prior <- pars$mu_prior * pars$sigma_prior\n# Calculating the likelihood for each parameter combination\nfor(i in 1:nrow(pars)) {\n  likelihoods <- dnorm(iq, pars$mu[i], pars$sigma[i])\n  pars$likelihood[i] <- prod(likelihoods)\n}\n# Calculate the probability of each parameter combination\npars$probability <- pars$likelihood * pars$prior / sum(pars$likelihood * pars$prior)\n```\n:::\n\n\nOk! The code for calculating the likelihood was a bit messy, but Bayes theorem stays the same.\n\n## Eyeballing the mean IQ of zombies?\n\nIn the last exercise, you computed the probability for each mean (`mu`) and SD (`sigma`) combination. Using the `levelplot` function from the `lattice` package we can now visualize this 2D probability distribution:\n\n\n<pre><code class=\"R language-R\">levelplot(probability ~ mu * sigma, data = pars)\n```\n\n<img src=\"https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/1300/datasets/ba53c55411008363e6656d2b30a62dd7e702e611/normal_zombie_2d_posterior.png\" alt>\n\nWe could calculate all kinds of credible intervals and probabilities from this plot, but just eyeballing it: \n\n\n* What is the most probable mean (`mu`) of the IQ of Zombies? Roughly how uncertain is the estimate of `mu`?\n> *Question*\n> ---\n> ???<br>\n> <br>\n> ⬜ A mean IQ of 20 ± 10<br>\n> ⬜ A mean IQ of 40 ± 1<br>\n> ⬜ A mean IQ of 15 ± 15<br>\n> ✅ A mean IQ of 42 ± 10<br>\n\nThat seems about right! Zombies are not very smart it seems. Who could have guessed…\n\n## Answering the question: Should I have a beach party?\n\nTheory. Coming soon ...\n\n\n**1. Answering the question: Should I have a beach party?**\n\nSo we have now done a whole analysis, you with zombie data, and I with temperature data. But I haven’t answered my original questions:\n\n**2. The questions**\n\nWhat’s likely the average water temperature for this lake on 20th of Julys, and what’s the probability the water temperature is going to be 18 or more on the next 20th? Right now\n\n**3. The posterior distribution**\n\nthe posterior probability distribution is represented as a data frame with one row per parameter combination with the corresponding probability. But my questions are much easier to answer if the posterior is represented as a large number of samples, like in earlier chapters. So, let’s draw a sample from this posterior. We’re going to use the sample function to draw row indices proportionally to each rows probability. We want to be able to sample any row from 1 to the last row, we’re drawing a sample of size 10,000 (just a large enough sample), we want to be able to draw a row index twice so we sample with replacement, and we draw each row index proportional to its corresponding probability.\n\n**4. The posterior distribution**\n\nsample_indices is now a long vector of numbers, which we’ll use to pick out the corresponding mu and sigma parameters in pars. Hey, a long data frame of samples that we now can use to calculate stuff with ease. Let’s start by plotting\n\n**5. The probability distribution over the mean temperature**\n\nthe probability distribution over the mean temperature. Looks like the mean is likely between 17 and 23 degrees. What would a 90% credible interval be here? We can calculate that using the quantile function\n\n**6. The probability distribution over the mean temperature**\n\nSo with 90% probability, the average temperature is between 17.5 and 22.5 degrees.\n\n**7. Is the temperature 18 or above on the 20th?**\n\nNow, what’s the probability of the temperature being 18 or above on the 20th of July? Not the average temperature, the actual temperature. To get to this we need to simulate some temperature data using rnorm, but instead of using fixed parameter values, we’ll feed in our samples.\n\n**8. Is the temperature 18 or above on the 20th?**\n\nHere we’re simulating 10000 values using the posterior distributions for mu and sigma. And as rnorm is vectorized, and implicitly loops over mu and sigma, the uncertainty in the posterior will propagate and be included in the uncertainty in pred_temp. If we\n\n**9. Is the temperature 18 or above on the 20th?**\n\nplot it, we now get the probability distribution over the water temperature on the 20th. What’s the probability that it is 18 degrees or above? Is it large enough, or should I cancel my beach party? For that, we just\n\n**10. Is the temperature 18 or above on the 20th?**\n\ncount up the proportion of samples that are 18 or more which gives us a 73% probability that the temperature in the lake is going to be 18 degrees or more. Good enough for me!\n\n**11. Beach party!**\n\nSo I’m doing a beach party, nice!\n\n**12. What about the IQ of zombies?**\n\nNow you try to answer some of your questions about the IQ of zombies.\n\n## Sampling from the zombie posterior\n\nAgain `pars` contains the data frame representing the posterior zombie IQ distribution you calculated earlier. The code to the right draws `sample_indices`: a sample of row numbers (a.k.a. *indices*) from the posterior.  Now, let's sample from `pars` to calculate some new measures!\n\n**Steps**\n\n1. Use `sample_indices` to create a new data frame `pars_sample` from `pars` with the columns `mu` and `sigma` drawn from the rows indicated by `sample_indices`.\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhead(pars)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<div data-pagedtable=\"false\">\n  <script data-pagedtable-source type=\"application/json\">\n{\"columns\":[{\"label\":[\"\"],\"name\":[\"_rn_\"],\"type\":[\"\"],\"align\":[\"left\"]},{\"label\":[\"mu\"],\"name\":[1],\"type\":[\"dbl\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]},{\"label\":[\"sigma\"],\"name\":[2],\"type\":[\"dbl\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]},{\"label\":[\"mu_prior\"],\"name\":[3],\"type\":[\"dbl\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]},{\"label\":[\"sigma_prior\"],\"name\":[4],\"type\":[\"dbl\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]},{\"label\":[\"prior\"],\"name\":[5],\"type\":[\"dbl\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]},{\"label\":[\"likelihood\"],\"name\":[6],\"type\":[\"dbl\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]},{\"label\":[\"probability\"],\"name\":[7],\"type\":[\"dbl\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]}],\"data\":[{\"1\":\"0.000000\",\"2\":\"0.1\",\"3\":\"0.002419707\",\"4\":\"0.02004008\",\"5\":\"4.849113e-05\",\"6\":\"0\",\"7\":\"0\",\"_rn_\":\"1\"},{\"1\":\"1.515152\",\"2\":\"0.1\",\"3\":\"0.002456367\",\"4\":\"0.02004008\",\"5\":\"4.922578e-05\",\"6\":\"0\",\"7\":\"0\",\"_rn_\":\"2\"},{\"1\":\"3.030303\",\"2\":\"0.1\",\"3\":\"0.002493009\",\"4\":\"0.02004008\",\"5\":\"4.996010e-05\",\"6\":\"0\",\"7\":\"0\",\"_rn_\":\"3\"},{\"1\":\"4.545455\",\"2\":\"0.1\",\"3\":\"0.002529617\",\"4\":\"0.02004008\",\"5\":\"5.069373e-05\",\"6\":\"0\",\"7\":\"0\",\"_rn_\":\"4\"},{\"1\":\"6.060606\",\"2\":\"0.1\",\"3\":\"0.002566174\",\"4\":\"0.02004008\",\"5\":\"5.142633e-05\",\"6\":\"0\",\"7\":\"0\",\"_rn_\":\"5\"},{\"1\":\"7.575758\",\"2\":\"0.1\",\"3\":\"0.002602661\",\"4\":\"0.02004008\",\"5\":\"5.215754e-05\",\"6\":\"0\",\"7\":\"0\",\"_rn_\":\"6\"}],\"options\":{\"columns\":{\"min\":{},\"max\":[10]},\"rows\":{\"min\":[10],\"max\":[10]},\"pages\":{}}}\n  </script>\n</div>\n`````\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsample_indices <- sample( nrow(pars), size = 10000,\n    replace = TRUE, prob = pars$probability)\nhead(sample_indices)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n#> [1] 1826 3432 2823 2334 1729 2029\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Sample from pars to calculate some new measures\npars_sample <- pars[sample_indices, c(\"mu\", \"sigma\")]\n```\n:::\n\n2.

Coming soon ...\n\n\n## The BEST models and zombies on a diet\n\nThe t-test is a classical statistical procedure used to compare the means of two data sets. In 2013 John Kruschke developed a souped-up Bayesian version of the t-test he named BEST (standing for *Bayesian Estimation Supersedes the t-test*). Let's try out BEST as implemented in the `BEST` package.\n\n**Steps**\n\n1. Zombies are stupid, but you and your colleagues at the *National Zombie Research Laboratory* are interested in how diet affects zombie intelligence. You have done a small experiment where you measured the IQ of 10 zombies on a regular diet and 10 zombies on a brain-based diet. The hypothesis is that zombies that eat more brains perform better on IQ tests. To the right, the data from the experiment is put into the variables `iq_brains` and `iq_regular`. \n\n    * Calculate the mean difference in IQ between the two groups by taking the mean of `iq_brains` minus the mean of `iq_regular`. Remember that `mean(iq_brains)` calculates the sample mean of `iq_brains`.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# The IQ of zombies on a regular diet and a brain based diet.\niq_brains <- c(44, 52, 42, 66, 53, 42, 55, 57, 56, 51)\niq_regular <- c(55, 44, 34, 18, 51, 40, 40, 49, 48, 46)\n\n# Calculate the mean difference in IQ between the two groups\nmean(iq_brains) - mean(iq_regular)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n#> [1] 9.3\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n2. It looks like zombies eating brains have higher IQ, but how sure should we be of this?\n\n    * Load in the `BEST` package using the `library()` function. \n    * Fit the BEST model using the `BESTmcmc` function, like this: `BESTmcmc(iq_brains, iq_regular)`. Assign the output of `BESTmcmc` to the variable `best_posterior`.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# The IQ of zombies on a regular diet and a brain based diet.\niq_brains <- c(44, 52, 42, 66, 53, 42, 55, 57, 56, 51)\niq_regular <- c(55, 44, 34, 18, 51, 40, 40, 49, 48, 46)\n\n# Calculate the mean difference in IQ between the two groups\nmean(iq_brains) - mean(iq_regular)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n#> [1] 9.3\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Fit the BEST model to the data from both groups\nlibrary(BEST)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\n#> Lade nötiges Paket: HDInterval\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbest_posterior <- BESTmcmc(iq_brains, iq_regular)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\n#> Waiting for parallel processing to complete...\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\n#> done.\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n3. Hey, the model ran! But we're none the wiser… \n\n    * Take a look at the posterior estimate of the difference in IQ between the normal and brain-diet zombies by running `plot(best_posterior)`.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# The IQ of zombies on a regular diet and a brain based diet.\niq_brains <- c(44, 52, 42, 66, 53, 42, 55, 57, 56, 51)\niq_regular <- c(55, 44, 34, 18, 51, 40, 40, 49, 48, 46)\n\n# Calculate the mean difference in IQ between the two groups\nmean(iq_brains) - mean(iq_regular)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n#> [1] 9.3\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Fit the BEST model to the data from both groups\nlibrary(BEST)\nbest_posterior <- BESTmcmc(iq_brains, iq_regular)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\n#> Waiting for parallel processing to complete...done.\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Plot the model result\nplot(best_posterior)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](19_fundamentals_of_bayesian_data_analysis_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-93-1.png){fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n> *Question*\n> ---\n> This plot shows the posterior probability distribution over the difference in means between `iq_brains` and `iq_regular`. On top of this you get:\n\n(1) The mean of the posterior as a \"best guess\" for the difference.\n\n(2) A 95% credible interval (called a 95% *Highest Density Interval* in the plot).\n\n(3) The amount of probability below and above *zero difference*.\n\n\n* What would be a reasonable conclusion to draw from this analysis?<br>\n> <br>\n> ⬜ There is no evidence that eating brains makes zombies *smarter*.<br>\n> ✅ There is some evidence that eating brains makes zombies *smarter*, but it's uncertain by how much.<br>\n> ⬜ There is some evidence that eating brains makes zombies *dumber*, but it's uncertain by how much.<br>\n> ⬜ Brain-eating zombies score 8 or more in IQ tests compared to normal zombies.<br>\n\nThis is a legitimate decision boundary as it lies in the gap between the clusters. Try again.\n\n## BEST is robust\n\nThe Bayesian model behind BEST assumes that the generative model for the data is a *t-distribution*; a more flexible distribution than the normal distribution as it assumes that data points might be outliers to some degree. This makes BEST's estimate of the mean difference *robust* to outliers in the data.\n\n**Steps**\n\n1. Assume that a super smart mutant zombie (IQ = 150) got into the `iq_regular` group by mistake. This might mess up the results as you and your colleagues really were interested in how diet affects *normal* zombies.\n\n    * Replace the last value in `iq_regular` with `150`.\n    * Again, calculate the difference in means between the two groups using the `mean()` function, that is, the mean of `iq_brains` minus the mean of `iq_regular`.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# The IQ of zombies given a regular diet and a brain based diet.\niq_brains <- c(44, 52, 42, 66, 53, 42, 55, 57, 56, 51)\niq_regular <- c(55, 44, 34, 18, 51, 40, 40, 49, 48, 150)\n\n# Modify the data above and calculate the difference in means\nmean(iq_brains) - mean(iq_regular)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n#> [1] -1.1\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n2. Just looking at the difference in sample means, it now seems like there is little to no effect of diet on IQ. Let's see how BEST deals with this outlier mutant zombie.\n\n    * Load in the `BEST` library.\n    * Fit the model using the `BESTmcmc(iq_brains, iq_regular)` function and assign the result to `best_posterior`. \n    * Plot `best_posterior` using the `plot()` function.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# The IQ of zombies given a regular diet and a brain based diet.\niq_brains <- c(44, 52, 42, 66, 53, 42, 55, 57, 56, 51)\niq_regular <- c(55, 44, 34, 18, 51, 40, 40, 49, 48, 150) # <- Mutant zombie\n\n# Modify the data above and calculate the difference in means\nmean(iq_brains) - mean(iq_regular)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n#> [1] -1.1\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Fit the BEST model to the modified data and plot the result\nlibrary(BEST)\nbest_posterior <- BESTmcmc(iq_brains, iq_regular)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\n#> Waiting for parallel processing to complete...done.\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nplot(best_posterior)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](19_fundamentals_of_bayesian_data_analysis_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-95-1.png){fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n> *Question*\n> ---\n> Looking at the plot, we see that the mutant zombie data point has made BEST more uncertain to some degree. But since BEST is robust to outliers, it still estimates that brain-eating zombies are more likely to have a higher IQ than zombies on a regular diet. \n\n\n* What conclusion should we draw?<br>\n> <br>\n> ⬜ There is zero evidence that eating brains make zombies smarter.<br>\n> ⬜ There is strong evidence that eating brains make zombies smarter.<br>\n> ✅ There is weak evidence that eating brains make zombies smarter. And we should be better at screening for mutant zombies when doing experiments.<br>\n\nThis is a legitimate decision boundary as it lies in the gap between the clusters.

You are now at the end of this course on the fundamentals of Bayesian data analysis using R. And we’ve come far!\n\n**2. We have covered**\n\nWe have seen Bayesian modeling as a way of quantifying uncertainty using probability, and we have covered what is needed to do Bayesian inference. You need\n\n**3. We have covered**\n\ndata,\n\n**4. We have covered**\n\na Bayesian model that consists of a generative model and prior probability distributions over parameters and unknowns, and finally you need\n\n**5. We have covered**\n\na computational method to fit the model.\n\n**6. We have covered**\n\nWe looked at two basic computational methods: Rejection sampling, where you directly sample from the generative model and then condition on the data by filtering away all samples that don’t match. And grid approximation, where you directly use Bayes theorem to calculate the probability over a grid of parameter combinations. But while we never explained it, we also used a Markov chain Monte Carlo method under the hood when we tried out that BEST model. We mainly looked at two generative models:\n\n**7. We have covered**\n\nThe binomial distribution and the normal distribution. But, we briefly used the Poisson distribution and touched on the t-distribution in the last exercise.\n\n**8. We have covered**\n\nWe learned how to work with samples representing the posterior probability distribution, and how to calculate new interesting measures, like the probability that zombies have an IQ over 60. Useful stuff. But this was a quick introduction, and there are many many\n\n**9. Things we didn't cover**\n\nthings we didn’t cover. We only looked at rather simple Bayesian models, and you might be left with the impression that Bayes is for these simple situations. But a Bayesian approach can be used all over machine learning and statistics, and there are Bayesian versions of things like time series models and deep learning. A great strength with Bayes is that you have great flexibility when setting prior distributions. But to be honest, we didn’t talk much about how to decide what priors and models to use. There is a lot to learn there, but there are also many good default priors and models you can use, like, for example, the BEST model. We didn’t contrast Bayesian statistics with classical statistics, which is so often done. One reason for this is that I don’t think it is that useful, it’s two different approaches, and better to learn the good things with both of them. We didn’t look at more advanced computational methods, like the many Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms there are, and we didn’t look at the many good computational tools and packages that now exist, like Stan and JAGS. And to explore one of these tools would be a good next step after this course.\n\n**10. Things we didn't cover**\n\nAaaand we didn’t really explain how Allan Turing used Bayesian statistics to break the German Enigma code. But he really did use Bayes! And while it’s not too complicated to explain, it does require you to learn all the specific details of how the Enigma machine worked. Maybe next time!\n\n**11. Go explore Bayes!**\n\nBayesian data analysis is increasingly being used all over data science and machine learning, and even if we just scratched the surface, you should now have the necessary knowledge to explore this exciting topic further.\n\n**12. Bye and thanks!**\n\nI’m Rasmus Bååth, Data Scientist, and Bayesian enthusiast, and thank you for staying with me to the end. Bye!\n\n**13. Let's practice!**\n\n\n\n",
